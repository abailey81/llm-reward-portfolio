"""Reason-gated Shumway delisting surcharge (data_pipeline/src/data/membership.py).

The frozen Refinitiv vault carries NO delisting reason (verified: rf_meta_* has only date/exchange/
sector, and the date is empty for all 333 dead RICs), so the −30/−55 surcharge is applied
UNCONDITIONALLY — including to premium M&A whose true terminal was positive (DELL buyout, TWX→AT&T,
ABMD→J&J, ...). The reason-gating plumbing is wired so that the moment the reason is re-pulled
(docs/DATA_REPULL_DELISTING.md), M&A names keep their real last return and only genuine performance
terminations are surcharged. These tests pin BOTH:

  * the gate is a strict NO-OP when the reason is absent (univ4 stays byte-identical — no fabrication);
  * once a reason IS present, M&A is withheld from the surcharge and performance/unknown is surcharged.

Run isolated (repo-root conftest binds the ENGINE's src; here src is data_pipeline's):
    PYTHONPATH=data_pipeline python -m pytest data_pipeline/tests/test_shumway_reason_gate.py --noconftest
