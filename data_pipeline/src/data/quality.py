"""Quality scoreboard, lineage map, and datasheet generation (stage 12).

Per-series quality score = weighted {coverage, reconciliation agreement, integrity
flag rate, freshness} (weights: config data.platform.quality_weights). The datasheet
follows Gebru et al., "Datasheets for Datasets" (CACM 2021), auto-filled from
manifests; anything not yet measurable stays ⟨TBD⟩ — never fabricated. The
stage-seed file drafts ONE dissertation data-chapter paragraph per pipeline stage,
each slot pulling a real number when it exists.
