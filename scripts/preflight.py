"""Pre-flight gauntlet — read-only GO/NO-GO checks before committing to the ~2-week campaign.

Each probe returns a ``Check(name, status, detail)``. A hard ``FAIL`` makes the script exit non-zero so a
supervisor or operator gates the run; ``WARN`` is advisory; ``PASS`` is green. NOTHING here mutates state —
the optional ``--probe`` is opt-in and the ONLY network call/spend (a REAL 1-token Anthropic liveness call,
M9: a dead key or empty credit must fail at t0, not at hour 3). The decision logic lives in pure functions
(unit-tested in ``tests/test_preflight.py``); ``main`` only gathers the measured inputs.

Run::

    python scripts/preflight.py --gpu 2            # checks for an n_gpu=2 campaign
    python scripts/preflight.py --gpu 3 --min-disk-gb 5 --probe

    RAM-available does NOT catch this (commit is RAM+pagefile, capped by C: free space).

    ⚠ CALIBRATED 2026-07-27 (Tamer: *"whatever my laptop can give, adapt"*). The floor was a
    HARDCODED 6.0 regardless of workload, while the sibling :func:`check_ram` scales as
    ``n_gpu * 2.2 + 3.0``. That mattered once the campaign moved to Myriad: on a cluster run the
    laptop TRAINS NOTHING — it only drives (submit/poll/pull) and authors — so RAM correctly relaxed
    to 3.0 GB while commit still demanded 6.0, failing the gauntlet on a workload that does not exist.

    MEASURED on this box, sampling the whole process tree at 20 Hz from outside:
      * cluster driver (dry-run, core AND a leg): peak **0.54 GB**, 2 processes
      * spawned validation child (the class the incident actually hurt): peak **1.33 GB**, 4 processes
      * freeze-gate child: 0.02 GB
    So the laptop's driver role needs ~1.3 GB at peak, and 6.0 was ~4.5x that.

    The floor now uses the SAME shape as ``check_ram`` so the two can never disagree about the
    workload again. Note this makes the check **STRICTER where the laptop really does train**
    (n_gpu=2 -> 7.4 GB, up from the flat 6.0) and honest where it does not (n_gpu=0 -> 3.0 GB, still
    a 2.25x margin over the measured 1.33 GB peak). ``min_gb`` remains overridable for callers that
