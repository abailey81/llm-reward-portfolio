# CAMPAIGN MONITOR (2026-07-18) — the proven v3 state-class pattern, pointed at the campaign.
# Run from the repo root in Git Bash, backgrounded, at launch (runbook §5a):
#   NTFY_URL=https://ntfy.sh/<private-topic> bash scripts/campaign_monitor.sh   # push opt-in
# Emits a line ONLY on change (state-class transitions for our campaign jobs, local record
# counts for the campaign roots, any Eqw, driver-heartbeat staleness >15 min). Quiet = healthy.
#
# ⚠ THE BATCH FILTER IS PART OF THE INSTRUMENT (fixed 2026-07-27). It matched only c1_/h3ss_, so
# under MODE D — where the core is ONE of TWELVE lines and the other ten are the replication legs
# tagged leg1..leg10 — this monitor watched the core and reported the legs as nothing at all. A
# monitor that sees zero rows emits nothing, and silence is this script's own signal for HEALTHY:
# ten dead driver lines would have looked exactly like ten healthy ones. Keep this regex in sync
# with the batch tags in scripts/mode_d_supervisor.ps1 ($legTag + "c1" + "h3ss").
# With NTFY_URL set, every emitted line is ALSO pushed to the phone (ntfy.sh-compatible POST;
# priority high when Eqw or a stale heartbeat is present — the two states that need a human).
# Best-effort: a failed POST never breaks the loop.
