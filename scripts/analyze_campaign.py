"""Campaign overfitting analysis — PBO/CSCV per arm (PREREGISTRATION §10; FINAL_PLAN B.9).

This is the CAMPAIGN analogue of ``scripts/analyze_results.py`` (which is correctly scoped
to the 1-seed DIRECTIONAL go/no-go and stays that way). Here we compute the project's
**primary overfitting guard**: the Probability of Backtest Overfitting via Combinatorially
Symmetric Cross-Validation (PBO/CSCV; Bailey et al. 2017), implemented in
``src.inference.overfitting.pbo``.

What PBO is computed over (the design, matching the spec)
--------------------------------------------------------
PBO is computed **PER ARM over that arm's search CANDIDATES**. For one arm we stack its
candidates' per-period **validation** return vectors (``metrics['val_returns']``) into a
performance matrix of shape ``(T_val, N_candidates)`` and ask, across all CSCV in-sample /
out-of-sample block splits, how often the IS-best candidate ranks below the OOS median —
i.e. whether the within-arm "pick the best candidate by validation fitness" selection
**overfits** (FINAL_PLAN B.9 line 100: "partition the performance matrix ... best-in-sample
config's OOS relative rank ... PBO = fraction with logit < 0"; ``overfitting.py`` docstring:
"a family of candidate strategies", trial count ill-defined under guided search).

This is distinct from the CPCV-on-winners evaluation-fold scheme (PREREGISTRATION §6: "CPCV
is applied to the fixed winners afterward for inference") which feeds the difference tests,
NOT this overfitting metric. ``config/inference.yaml`` keeps them separate: ``pbo.n_blocks``
(this metric) vs ``splits.cpcv`` (the evaluation folds).

Inputs
------
Results are read ONLY through ``src.io.results.load_all`` (audit C-1). All seven arms persist
the per-candidate validation vector ``metrics['val_returns']`` during search (LLM arms via
``src/llm/loop.py``; search arms via ``scripts/run_prototype.py`` /
``src/orchestration/parallel.py``). ``n_blocks`` is read from ``config/inference.yaml``
``pbo.n_blocks`` (= 16).

DIRECTIONAL caveat: like the prototype, a single-seed development-split campaign is a
go/no-go on the mechanism. The PBO table is a campaign tool; it is meaningful only on the
real multi-candidate per-arm archives.

Campaign-inference additions (Rank 8 — operate on the TEST leg)
--------------------------------------------------------------
The functions below consume the per-(arm, seed) **frozen-winner TEST records** that
``scripts/run_campaign.py`` writes (each carrying ``metrics['test_returns']`` — the
realized per-step held-out 2020-2026 portfolio returns). They wire the FROZEN
pre-registration's selection-aware machinery into the campaign:

- :func:`collect_family_pvalues` — enumerate the pre-registered **arm-contrast × held-out
  metric** family (Sharpe + CVaR at the pre-reg levels) via the rliable PER-SEED difference
  test (per-seed scores → IQM → paired stratified bootstrap over the shared training seeds;
  ``src.inference.bootstrap.paired_seed_difference_test``), then Benjamini-Hochberg the
  p-values at ``config/inference.yaml: multiplicity.q = 0.05`` (PREREGISTRATION §10 + R16;
  FINAL_PLAN B.9 line 104, "Multiple-testing correction across the arm × metric family").
- :func:`romano_wolf_joint` — a JOINT Romano-Wolf stepdown that draws ONE shared
  **SEED-index resample** per replication and evaluates every hypothesis's per-seed IQM
  difference on it (so the cross-hypothesis dependence the stepdown relies on is preserved
  AND the across-seed variance is carried), feeding the existing
  ``src.inference.multiple_testing.romano_wolf`` stepdown. See that module's note in
  :func:`romano_wolf_joint` for why the shared resample is required (R16, 2026-06-20:
  the per-seed analogue of the prior series block-bootstrap).
- :func:`h2_conjunction` — the pre-registered **HEADLINE** test. H2 (PREREGISTRATION §1;
  FINAL_PLAN B.6 line 83) holds only if distributional beats scalar **and** survives
  beyond the **placebo** (information ≠ token-count) **and** beyond **scalar+CVaR-5%**
  (tail-shape ≠ any-downside-number): ``H2_supported`` iff ALL THREE legs reject in the
  predicted direction *after* the family-wise/FDR correction.
- :func:`benchmark_floor` — the DeMiguel 1/N floor (PREREGISTRATION §9 benchmark suite;
  §10). Rolls the EIGHT distinct benchmark weight policies (equal_weight=1/N, mean_variance,
  risk_parity, hrp, minimum_variance, maximum_diversification, inverse_volatility,
  cross_sectional_momentum; R19) through the IDENTICAL ``PortfolioEnv`` + cost via a
  minimal :class:`WeightPolicy` shim and ``src.env.runner.rollout_port_returns``, then
  gates the frozen winner's test Deflated Sharpe **>** the best benchmark's. This is a
  POST-FREEZE report-only gate — it NEVER re-selects the winner.

All four MATCH the frozen pre-registration; they do not invent a new family or conjunction
(STOP-AND-FLAG notes are inlined where the spec leaves a choice).

    """Recompute each arm's HEADLINE winner Deflated Sharpe with the CANONICAL cross-trial var (Rank 16).

    Fixes the cross-trial-variance defect in the WIRED selection path: during search,
    ``src.selection.fitness.held_out_fitness`` calls ``deflated_sharpe_ratio`` with
    ``var_sr=None`` (the within-series SAMPLING-variance proxy), because the population
    variance over ALL an arm's candidates is not knowable inside the per-candidate loop. The
    canonical Bailey-Lopez de Prado DSR instead deflates by the cross-TRIAL Sharpe
    DISPERSION; on a heterogeneous candidate population the two diverge (the proxy mis-states
    the DSR). This is the clean analysis-time recompute: per arm it

      1. reconstructs the candidate population's per-period **validation** Sharpes from the
         recorded ``metrics['val_returns']`` (the SAME columns :func:`build_perf_matrix`
         stacks for PBO -- one Sharpe per candidate);
      2. forms the empirical cross-candidate dispersion ``var_sr = Var(sharpes, ddof=1)``;
      3. identifies the WINNER (the candidate selected during search -- max
         ``metrics['val_fitness']``, EXACTLY ``run_campaign.select_winner`` /
         ``analyze_results._winner``);
      4. recomputes the winner's DSR over its OWN validation returns deflated by that
         population ``var_sr``, alongside the proxy DSR (``var_sr=None``) for comparison.

    DSR is the SECONDARY overfitting diagnostic (PBO/CSCV is primary, ``var``-free); this
    corrects the secondary number that may be reported.

    Parameters
    ----------
    records : list of dict
        All per-candidate run records (``src.io.results.load_all``); split by ``arm``.
    arms : sequence of str, optional
        Arms to report (default: the six pre-registered arms). An arm with fewer than two
        candidates carrying a usable validation vector is reported as skipped (a single
        candidate has no cross-trial dispersion -- ``ddof=1`` variance is undefined).
    periods_per_year : int
        Forwarded to ``deflated_sharpe_ratio`` (annualization-invariant; kept for symmetry).

    Returns

    dict[str, dict]

        candidate carries no usable ``val_returns`` (the DSR winner is then a disclosed

    root : str or Path

    winner_ids : sequence of str, optional
        The frozen winners' ``candidate_id``s (e.g. ``"<arm>-g6-c3"``). When an anomaly event carries a
        ``candidate_id``/``cand`` field, a run whose events name a winner id is flagged in
        ``winner_diverged``. (The prototype anomaly schema has no candidate id, so this is best-effort and
        reports ``winner_diverged=[]`` / ``winner_attribution="unavailable"`` there — never a false claim.)
    kinds : tuple of str, optional
        The anomaly ``kind`` values that count as a training DIVERGENCE (default ``("critic_explosion",)``;
        the NaN/inf ``nonfinite_metric`` kind can be added by the caller). Non-divergence kinds (resource
        pressure, FPS) are excluded from the run/line tallies but still parsed for clustering context.

    gate + were evaluated), how many FAILED the gate, and the arm's total prompt (input) tokens. REPORT-ONLY
    and DISJOINT (``out["compute_accounting"]``; no family-tuple keys).

    Two asymmetries it discloses (both CONSERVATIVE for the LLM headline / controlled):

    (i) **Failure asymmetry → favours search (against the LLM headline).** An LLM arm BURNS a budget slot on
        a gate failure (``src/llm/loop.py`` ~338,380: the failure is archived and the loop moves on), so it
        evaluates ``budget − n_failed`` valid candidates. A search arm RESAMPLES on a gate failure
        (``src/search/random_search.py`` ~259: ``SandboxError`` ``continue``s WITHOUT spending a budget
        unit), so it always reaches a FULL slate of valid candidates. Search therefore gets strictly MORE
        valid candidates per matched budget — a HANDICAP on the LLM arms, i.e. conservative for H2.

    (ii) **Token asymmetry → controlled by the placebo leg.** The tail-aware feedback block carries ~8
        feedback lines (the six tail stats + headers) vs the scalar arm's 1, so the distributional arm sends
        more prompt tokens. That token-count difference is the EXACT thing the inert ``placebo`` arm (matched
        block length, zero information) controls for in the H2 placebo leg — so the headline already nets the
        token count out of the distributional-vs-scalar contrast.

    Parameters
    ----------
    records : list of dict
        All loaded run records; the per-arm ACCEPTED count is the number of SEARCH candidates
        (:func:`_is_search_candidate`) for that arm.
    root : str or Path
        Archive root holding ``<arm>/`` (prototype) or ``search/<arm>/`` (campaign) provenance files.
    arms : sequence of str, optional
        Arms to tabulate (default the six pre-registered arms).

        for an LLM arm this equals ``n_llm_calls`` when every call is accounted. Arms with no provenance

    """Enumerate the pre-registered arm-contrast × held-out-metric family; record one-sided + BH decisions.

    For every ``(arm_a, arm_b)`` contrast and every held-out metric — the Sharpe ratio and the CVaR
    at each pre-registered ``cvar_levels`` — runs the rliable per-seed difference test (Agarwal et al.
    2021): each arm's PER-SEED scores (Sharpe / CVaR of every seed's frozen-winner test series) are
    reduced to an IQM point estimate, and a PAIRED stratified bootstrap over the shared training SEEDS
    (``src.inference.bootstrap.paired_seed_difference_test``) tests the IQM difference — carrying the
    across-seed (training-RNG) variance.

    R25 (2026-06-25, PREREGISTRATION §1/§10): the HEADLINE decision is now per-test ONE-SIDED in the
    predicted direction (``a`` better than ``b``). R64 (2026-06-28): ``p_one`` is the bootstrap's DIRECT
    upper-tail one-sided p (``res["pvalue_one_sided_greater"]`` = ``P(boot - obs >= obs)``), used when
    ``direction_ok`` (the effect is in-direction), else the one-sided test does NOT reject. This replaces
    the earlier ``p_two / 2`` (DEEP_H2 A5), which equals the true one-sided tail only under a symmetric
    bootstrap and mis-states it under any skew of the CVaR-5% difference. Each test therefore carries a
    ``pvalue_one_sided`` and a ``reject_one_sided`` (``direction_ok AND p_one <= alpha_one_sided``);
    :func:`h2_conjunction` partitions these into the two co-primary intersection-union tests (H2-RA
    on the 3 Sharpe legs, H2-Tail on the 3 CVaR-5% legs), each gated by its own 3-leg IUT with NO
    further leg correction (the conjunction IS the correction — Berger 1982; DEEP_H2 §3.3 option A).

    The Benjamini-Hochberg rejection set over the WHOLE m=6 union (level ``q``;
    ``config/inference.yaml: multiplicity.q = 0.05``) is STILL computed and returned as ``reject_bh``,
    but it is now a REPORTED SENSITIVITY (DEEP_H2 §3.3 option B), NOT the headline gate — the old
    ``(conjunction o BH-over-6)`` double-corrected (Berger 1982) and was under-powered against H2.

    NB (#9/#14, 2026-06-20): this replaces the prior construction, which AVERAGED the per-seed return
    series per arm and fed that single denoised series to a single-strategy stationary block-bootstrap.
    Averaging N i.i.d.-seed paths shrinks the tested object's variance ~N×, so that test was
    anti-conservative (the inflation grows with the across-seed variance — ~21% true-null rejection at
    the 5% level in a representative 30-seed calibration vs the correctly-sized ~5% here). The valid
    series-level tests (``sharpe_difference_test`` /
    ``cvar_difference_test``) remain for single-realization use; the campaign family uses the per-seed
    test. ``sharpe_p`` is retained for signature stability but no longer applies (seeds are i.i.d.).

    The bootstrap difference tests are two-sided; the rejection set returned here is the raw
    two-sided BH set. The DIRECTIONAL post-correction decision (reject AND in the predicted
    direction ``a`` better than ``b``) is layered on by :func:`h2_conjunction`; the per-test
    ``direction_ok`` flag and the signed effect are recorded here so the caller need not
    re-run the bootstrap.

    Parameters
    ----------
    records : list of dict
        Per-(arm, seed) frozen-winner TEST records (carry ``metrics['test_returns']``).
    contrasts : tuple of (str, str), optional
        Arm pairs ``(a, b)`` read "a predicted better than b". Default: :data:`H2_CONTRASTS`.
    cvar_levels : tuple of float, optional
        CVaR tail levels for the CVaR-difference leg of the family (default the headline
        fitness level ``0.05``; PREREGISTRATION §4 also freezes ``cvar_01`` — pass
        ``(0.05, 0.01)`` to include it, flagged high-variance there).
    sharpe_p, n_boot : float, int
        Stationary-bootstrap block-restart probability and replication count forwarded to
        the difference tests.
    q : float, optional
        Benjamini-Hochberg FDR level (``config/inference.yaml: multiplicity.q``).
    rng : numpy.random.Generator, optional
        Seeded for reproducibility.

        "n_family": int, "skipped": [...]}``. ``effect`` is the signed ``stat_a - stat_b``

    Why a joint draw (the Rank-8 STOP-AND-FLAG on ``multiple_testing.romano_wolf``)

    ``src.inference.multiple_testing.romano_wolf`` is a *pure stepdown* over a precomputed
    ``(n_boot, n_hypotheses)`` ``boot_stats`` whose joint max is valid **iff** each ROW is one joint
    draw of all hypotheses under a SHARED resample. This routine builds that: it draws ONE SEED-index
    resample per replication and evaluates EVERY contrast's IQM-difference on that single shared draw,
    so the columns of each row share a resample (joint draw) AND the across-seed (training-RNG)
    variance is carried. It is the rliable (Agarwal et al. 2021) per-seed analogue of the prior
    series block-bootstrap, which fed a seed-AVERAGED series to the stepdown and was anti-conservative

    The frozen headline (:func:`h2_conjunction` -> :func:`collect_family_pvalues`, rf=0) is UNCHANGED.
    This recomputes the SAME family with the per-period FRED ``DGS3MO`` rate subtracted from the SHARPE leg
    (the CVaR leg, a RAW-loss tail measure, stays on raw returns) and reports — per contrast — the rf=0 vs
    excess effect / p-value / direction / one-sided rejection, and whether the H2-RA Sharpe IUT (the
    distributional arm beats all three comparators one-sided at α; R25) holds BOTH ways.

    Why this matters (PREREGISTRATION R20). The per-seed Sharpe rf penalty is ``mean(rf)*sqrt(252)/sigma``
    — LARGER for LOWER-volatility arms. If the distributional (tail-aware) arm wins partly by producing
    lower realised volatility, the excess-return effect is SMALLER than the rf=0 effect. So rf is NOT a
    harmless constant for the arm contrast; this quantifies the shrinkage and certifies whether the
    headline is robust to the risk-free convention.

    Parameters
    ----------
    records : list of dict
        Per-(arm, seed) frozen-winner TEST records (carry ``metrics['test_returns']``).
    risk_free : np.ndarray
        Per-period rf vector for the TEST window (e.g.
        ``market_reference.load_risk_free_daily(panel.dates[test_start:test_end]).daily``), aligned to
        each per-seed test series (which starts at ``test_start``), so ``rf[:v.size]`` pairs element-wise.

    Two pre-registered difference tests on the SEALED test leg, each mirroring the H2-RA per-seed IQM
    paired bootstrap exactly (per-seed Sharpe -> IQM -> PAIRED stratified bootstrap over the shared
    training seeds; ``src.inference.bootstrap.paired_seed_difference_test``), one-sided in the predicted

      * **H4b** — ``distributional`` vs ``bayes_opt`` (Bayesian-opt-over-template).

    SCOPE (DEEP_H4 §1.2 — state precisely; this function only computes, the write-up scopes): H4a is the
    closest to a *procedure-at-comparable-richness* comparison (both emit code); H4b is an *open-ended
    language vs fixed parametric family* comparison. Neither asserts "the LLM is a better optimiser over
    an identical space" — the LLM's hypothesis space is deliberately richer.

    REFERENCE FRAMING (T3.4 (b); DEEP_H4 §1.2): each control is reported with its :data:`_H4_REFERENCE_FRAMING`
    label — H4a as the IN-FAMILY random-search REFERENCE (the same six-term family the LLM authors over, R28)
    and H4b as the fixed-parametric-template reference — so H4 reads as **procedure-vs-richness**, not a bare
    nested horse-race. The label rides on each test row + a top-level ``reference_framing`` map.

    EQUIVALENCE (T3.4 (a); DEEP_H4 §1.2): each leg ALSO carries a symmetric ``±equiv_margin`` TOST on the
    per-seed Sharpe-IQM difference (:func:`_iqm_tost`), exactly as H3 does — so a non-rejection of H4 against
    a control can be reported as a BOUNDED equivalence ("the LLM and the in-family search are equivalent
    within ±0.05 in Sharpe-IQM units") rather than mere absence of evidence (Lakens 2017). This closes the
    H4-vs-H3 asymmetry (H3 had a TOST bound; H4 did not).

    MULTIPLICITY (DEEP_H4 §4 A5): H4 is its OWN family of 2 tests {H4a, H4b}, NOT in the frozen m=6 H2
    family. A Bonferroni-over-2 reported decision (``reject_one_sided_bonferroni`` at ``alpha/2``) is
    carried alongside the per-test one-sided decision so the 2-test multiplicity is explicit; the
    per-test one-sided p is also returned for transparency.

    DISJOINT KEY: writes ``out["h4"]`` with NO ``arm_a/arm_b/metric/level`` family-tuple keys (it uses
    ``test`` + ``a``/``b`` + ``contrast``), so ``assert_realized_family_matches_frozen`` never sees it and
    the frozen H2 family is untouched.

    """H3 — iterative reflection vs single-shot best-of-N, at matched budget (DEEP_H3; PREREGISTRATION §1/§6).

    The canonical contrast (DEEP_H3 §1.1, §2.1-i), WITHIN the ``arm`` (default distributional): the
    ITERATIVE condition (the headline reflect-on-best search winner, in ``iterative_records``) vs the
    SINGLE-SHOT condition (1 generation, best-of-(G·M), in ``single_shot_records`` — D-2 archives it under
    ``test_h3_singleshot/distributional``), winner selection identical (best validation DSR), both re-run
    at the same campaign seeds.

    THREE decisions are reported (DEEP_H3 §8.1-8.2):
      * a **difference test** — per-seed Sharpe -> IQM -> PAIRED stratified bootstrap over shared seeds
        (mirroring H2-RA, one-sided "iterative better than single-shot"); and
      * a **TOST equivalence** at ``±equiv_margin`` in the test-statistic's (per-seed Sharpe IQM) units —
        the bankable-null bound ("iterative ≈ single-shot within ±0.05"), the DEEP_H3 §8.2 move that turns
        a non-rejection into a bounded finding; and
      * a **paired placebo-relative uplift difference** (T3.4 c; :func:`_h3_placebo_relative_uplift`) — the
        difference between the distributional arm's (iterative − single-shot) uplift and the ``placebo_arm``'s,
        so a null reads as "reflection left no information-tracking signature beyond content-free reflection".
        It rides in ``out["placebo_relative_uplift"]`` and GRACEFULLY SKIPS unless a placebo single-shot
        condition is also present (the headline single-shot stage runs only the distributional arm), so it is
        never fabricated.

    DEEP_H3's pre-registered prediction is the NULL/equivalence (reflection is expected to be weak in this
    sparse, noisy-verifier regime); this frames the likely null as a bounded finding, not a defect.

    GRACEFUL SKIP: when ``single_shot_records`` is ``None``/empty (the single-shot archive is absent — it
    is a SEPARATE, manually-launched run, DEEP_H3 §2.3/§2.4), returns ``status="skipped"`` so H3 simply is
    not reported rather than fabricated.

    The bankable-null complement to :func:`h2_conjunction`. For EACH H2 contrast (distributional vs
    {scalar, placebo, scalar_cvar5}) and EACH co-primary metric — Sharpe (H2-RA) and CVaR-5% (H2-Tail) —
    runs the symmetric ``±equiv_margin`` TOST on the per-seed IQM difference (:func:`_iqm_tost`), in the
    test-statistic's OWN units (per-seed Sharpe / CVaR, NOT validation-DSR). A leg is "equivalent" iff its
    90% paired bootstrap CI for ``IQM(a) - IQM(b)`` lies inside ``(-margin, +margin)``.

    So a non-rejection of an H2 leg can be reported as a BOUNDED effect ("distributional and scalar are
    equivalent within ±0.05 in Sharpe-IQM units") rather than mere absence of evidence (Lakens 2017;
    PREREGISTRATION §10 R12 frames the SESOI in validation-DSR units — this is the test-statistic-units
    companion the prompt specifies, reported alongside).

    P6-code (2026-07-01). The raw ±0.05 CVaR-Tail band is LARGE relative to the CVaR magnitude (a daily
    CVaR-5% is O(0.01–0.06)), so a ±0.05 band can trivially contain the CI and over-claim equivalence.
    ALONGSIDE the raw band, each tail leg therefore ALSO reports a RELATIVE band expressed as a FRACTION
    (``tail_margin_fraction``, default 25%) of the |baseline CVaR| — the comparator arm's IQM CVaR — so the
    equivalence is stated in a scale-appropriate, interpretable unit ("within 25% of the baseline tail
    loss"). Both verdicts are reported; NEITHER gates. The RA (Sharpe) leg is unchanged (Sharpe is unitless,
    so a fractional restatement is not meaningful there).

    """The bankable-null TOST in **validation-DSR units** (the SESOI's units; docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md, T2.5).

    Companion to :func:`h2_tost` (which bounds the difference in the test-statistic's OWN per-seed
    Sharpe/CVaR units, ±0.05). The FROZEN SESOI / equivalence margin (PREREGISTRATION §10 R12) is specified
    in **validation-DSR** units — the SELECTION metric — and ``docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md`` is explicit that a
    campaign non-rejection only licenses a *practical-equivalence* claim if the TOST CI lies inside ±0.05 in
    **DSR units** (otherwise the result is INCONCLUSIVE, not equivalence). The Sharpe-units leg alone is at
    most inconclusive for that claim. This function computes the missing DSR-units leg so a non-rejection
    actually evaluates the equivalence the power doc requires.

    Method (report-only, DISJOINT). For each H2 RA contrast (distributional vs {scalar, placebo,
    scalar_cvar5}) it takes each arm's PER-SEED annualised Sharpe (:func:`_seed_scores` + ``sharpe_ratio`` —
    the SAME per-seed scores the headline difference test uses, carrying the across-seed variance) and maps
    each into a CONSERVATIVE (upper-bound) validation-DSR shift via
    ``power_analysis.sharpe_mde_to_dsr`` — the documented linear ceiling
    ``ΔDSR_max = φ(0)·√(T−1)/√252 · ΔSR_ann`` (T2.5). Because the map is linear and positive, the per-seed
    DSR-unit scores are an order-preserving rescaling of the Sharpe scores, so the PAIRED bootstrap CI for
    ``mean(a) − mean(b)`` is computed honestly in DSR units; equivalence holds iff that 90% CI lies inside
    ``±sesoi_dsr`` (``power_analysis.tost_equivalence`` with ``paired=True`` — CRN seed pairing, matching the
    headline difference test's across-seed covariance; Lakens 2017). The ceiling is the HONEST direction:
    it OVER-states ΔDSR (φ(z)≤φ(0), D≥1 off-the-money / fat-tailed), so a DSR-equivalence verdict here is a
    fortiori true under the exact map; a NON-equivalent verdict is reported as INCONCLUSIVE (the conservative
    map could not certify a bound that small), never as evidence of a difference.

    Tail (CVaR) has NO validation-DSR analogue (the DSR is a Sharpe/PSR selection statistic), so this leg is
    RA-only by construction; the CVaR equivalence stays in :func:`h2_tost` (its own units). ``sesoi_dsr``
    defaults to the FROZEN ``inference.equivalence_margin`` (0.05) read from config; ``track_length`` to the
    power module's ``VALIDATION_TRACK_LENGTH``.

    DISJOINT KEY: writes ``out["h2_tost_dsr"]`` with NO ``arm_a/arm_b/metric/level`` family-tuple keys, so
    the frozen m=6 union + :func:`assert_realized_family_matches_frozen` are untouched (the equivalence
    secondary already declared in ``config/preregistration.yaml: inference.secondary_families`` /
    ``h2_tost_equivalence``; this adds the DSR-units companion the doc specifies, never a gate).

    that estimator routes EVT/GPD vs empirical, with a fallback inside ``_evt_cvar``: when the requested
    ``alpha`` exceeds the tail-exceedance fraction ``F_u`` (``alpha > fu``), the GPD fit is degenerate
    (non-finite beta), or the shape leaves the regular MLE region (xi >= 1 infinite-mean / xi <= -0.5
    non-regular, Smith 1985 — T2.8a), it FALLS BACK to the empirical estimator. If that fallback fires for SOME
    arms' winners but not others, the distributional vs scalar_cvar5 tail comparison would mix EVT and
    empirical CVaR — an estimator inconsistency that DEEP_H2 §6.3 flags.

    This re-derives, per arm winner (the most-recent / highest-fitness candidate carrying ``val_returns``),

class WeightPolicy:
    """A ``predict``-compatible shim that rolls a benchmark WEIGHT policy through the env.

    The benchmark allocators in ``src.baselines.strategies`` map a returns window to a
    target weight vector on the simplex. ``rollout_port_returns`` / ``PortfolioEnv`` instead
    drive a *policy* that emits a raw ACTION which the env projects onto the simplex via its
    FROZEN ``action.projection``. This shim bridges the two so a benchmark rolls through the
    IDENTICAL ``PortfolioEnv`` + transaction cost as the learned agent:

      1. reconstruct the per-asset lookback returns window from the observation — the env's
         ``_obs`` packs ``returns[t-lookback:t].ravel()`` as the LEADING ``lookback*N``
         block, so ``obs[:lookback*N].reshape(lookback, N)`` recovers exactly the window the
         strategy functions consume (no look-ahead — it is strictly-past data);
      2. call the benchmark ``strategy(window, cfg) -> w_risky`` (N risky weights on the
         simplex; the strategies are long-only, fully-invested in the risky sleeve);
      3. return an ACTION that the env's projection maps back to ``[w_risky, cash=0]``
         EXACTLY: for ``softmax`` return ``log(w)`` (softmax(log w) == w, up to the additive
         constant softmax is invariant to); for ``l1_normalize_of_clipped`` return ``w``
         itself (already non-negative and L1-normalised). A tiny floor avoids ``log(0)``.

    So the realized per-step net return the env reports for a 1/N policy is the genuine
    cost-charged equal-weight return — the DeMiguel floor, measured on the SAME leg.

    disclosed sensitivity BRACKET around that measured answer.
    Empirically the whole ``d∈{0,−1}`` sweep moves the pooled test CVaR-5% by only ~2% (105 test-window
    delisting cells — measured pre-Split-C on the 2018–2025 window; re-derived at analyze time on the
    executed window), a tiny fraction of the pooled return population, so the headline tail
    ORDERING is shown INVARIANT across the band — the M&A contamination is bounded and immaterial to the
    H2 conclusion, even though it would badly bias a per-name delisting study. The superseded reason-gated
    re-pull procedure remains documented (``docs/DATA_REPULL_DELISTING.md``), NOT fabricated here (R4).

    Cell location (verified, not the audit ``date``)
    ------------------------------------------------
    The audit log's ``date`` is the delisting EVENT/booking date (~13 sessions AFTER the corrected
    session); the Shumway value is booked onto each dead name's **last valid return session**. So each
    audit ``ric`` is mapped to its last non-NaN session in ``panel_df`` (which is exactly the one cell
    where ``univ4`` differs from ``univ3``, carrying the audit ``value`` — confirmed 333/333), and only
    those whose session lands in the test window are overwritten.

    Parameters
    ----------
    panel_df : pandas.DataFrame, optional
        The returns panel (sessions × RICs). Defaults to the band's PINNED panel
        (``returns_panel_{DELISTING_BAND_AUDIT_SUFFIX}`` = ``univ4``), independent of ``gold_suffix()`` —
        the headline default (post-R44 ``univ3``; ``univ5`` post-Split-C) carries no Shumway audit log.
        Injectable for the unit test.
    audit_df : pandas.DataFrame, optional
        The Shumway audit log (columns ``ric``, ``delisting_return``, ``value``; 333 rows for univ4).
        Defaults to ``data/clean/shumway_audit_log_<DELISTING_BAND_AUDIT_SUFFIX>.parquet`` (= ``univ4``). Injectable.
    test_window_dates : (start, end), optional
        Inclusive session bounds. Defaults to the frozen evaluation span
        (``config/inference.yaml: splits.evaluation.span`` = 2020-01-01 … 2026-06-30, SPLIT C).
        The window is CLAMPED to the band panel's available span (the univ4-era panel ends 2025-12,
        so the Split-C 2026H1 overhang is outside the band audit) and any clamp is RECORDED in the
        output (``window_requested`` / ``window_clamped_to`` / ``window_clamp_note``).
    grid, levels : tuple of float
        The delisting-return grid and the CVaR tail levels (default the co-primary 0.05 + the 0.01 EVT).
    gold_dir : Path or str, optional
        Override the gold/clean parent dir (defaults to ``data/gold`` resolved from the repo root).

    """Roll the benchmark suite through the SAME costed test env; gate the winner's DSR.

    Implements the DeMiguel 1/N floor (PREREGISTRATION §9 benchmark suite; §10) as a
    POST-FREEZE, report-only gate. Each benchmark weight policy is rolled through the
    IDENTICAL ``PortfolioEnv`` over ``test_window`` via :class:`WeightPolicy` +
    ``src.env.runner.rollout_port_returns`` (so every benchmark pays the same transaction
    cost as the learned winner), and its test Sharpe / CVaR / MaxDD / Deflated Sharpe are
    reported. The gate requires the FROZEN winner's test-DSR to strictly exceed the best
    benchmark's test-DSR — it NEVER re-selects the winner (the winner was frozen on
    validation; this only reports pass/fail against the floor).

    Parameters
    ----------
    panel : Panel
        The shared panel (the test window indexes into it).
    cfg : Any
        The environment config (``config/environment.yaml``) — the same object the campaign
        builds the env from, so lookback / projection / cost match exactly.
    test_window : (int, int)
        Half-open ``[start, end)`` test window (the campaign's resolved 2020-2026 leg).
    strategies : dict[str, callable], optional
        ``{name: strategy_fn}`` override (default: the eight frozen benchmarks from
        ``src.baselines.strategies``).
    winner_test_returns : np.ndarray, optional
        The frozen winner's realized per-step TEST returns. When given, the floor gate is
        evaluated (winner DSR vs best-benchmark DSR); otherwise only the benchmark table is
        returned (``gate`` is ``None``).
    n_trials : int
        Trial count for the Deflated Sharpe (the winner is ONE frozen strategy -> 1; the
        benchmarks are likewise un-searched). Forwarded to ``deflated_sharpe_ratio``.
    cvar_alpha : float
        CVaR tail level for the reported benchmark CVaR (default headline ``0.05``).

    Implements PREREGISTRATION §1 (H1) / §9 (hand-reward panel) (Eureka-style, Ma et al. 2024) as a
    POST-FREEZE, REPORT-ONLY panel that is DISJOINT from the frozen H2 family — it writes
    ``out["h1_beat_human"]`` and carries NO ``arm_a/arm_b/metric/level`` keys, so
    ``assert_realized_family_matches_frozen`` never sees it and the frozen ``m=6`` testing family is
    untouched. It does NOT re-select the LLM winner (frozen on validation); it only reports the LLM
    winner's realized TEST performance against the hand baselines. (The "§18-19" cite previously here was
    WRONG: "18-19" were line numbers given in error; the pre-registration has only 12 numbered sections —
    H1 is §1, the hand-reward panel §9. DEEP_H1 C-1.)

    The comparison (matched budget, the FAIR Eureka asymmetry):
      * the LLM ``winner_arm`` was SEARCHED, so its Deflated Sharpe is deflated by its OWN search
        multiplicity (``winner_n_trials``, e.g. 30 candidates) — the same N the headline winner-DSR uses;
      * each ``baseline_<name>`` is UN-SEARCHED (a fixed hand reward), so its DSR is deflated by N=1 — like
        the 8 allocators in :func:`benchmark_floor`. This asymmetry FAVOURS the baselines (a higher human
        bar), i.e. it is CONSERVATIVE for H1.

    Best-baseline IDENTITY selected on VALIDATION (DEEP_H1 T-REF data-snoop fix): the "best of the four"
    is an order statistic, so choosing it on the SAME sealed-test data the win is reported on data-snoops
    the comparator's identity (White 2000). When the baseline records carry a validation signal, the best
    baseline is picked by its VALIDATION score — in ONE unit chosen all-or-nothing for the whole baseline
    set (``selection_metric``: the annualized ``val_returns`` Sharpe if ANY baseline archives it, else the
    ``val_fitness`` DSR-like scalar; the two are incommensurate units and are never mixed per-record) —
    and the LLM-vs-that-FIXED-baseline gap is then reported on the sealed test leg (a pre-committed,
    Dunnett-valid comparator). If NO baseline archives a validation
    signal (the campaign's baseline TEST stage writes ``val_fitness=NaN`` and no ``val_returns`` — DEEP_H1
    §3.1), this FALLS BACK to test-median selection and FLAGS it (``best_selected_on`` records which, and
    ``val_snoop_caveat`` is set) so the data-snoop is disclosed, never hidden.

    The metrics — the single-task fraction-beaten + normalised-improvement, cited as "Eureka-STYLE" (NOT
    Eureka's Human Normalized Score ``(Method − Sparse)/|Human − Sparse|``, which needs a sparse
    ground-truth anchor finance lacks and is therefore NOT computable here — DEEP_H1 C-2; the repo metric
    is a relative-Sharpe improvement, an inspired analogue, not the identical Eureka formula):
      * ``best_baseline`` — the hand reward selected as above (the human bar);
      * ``beat_fraction`` — the SINGLE-TASK fraction-beaten: the fraction of the LLM winner's per-seed test
        Sharpes that exceed the best baseline's central-tendency Sharpe (the single-task, OOS analogue of
        Eureka's cross-task "fraction of tasks beaten"; a Bernoulli over SEEDS, not tasks);
      * ``norm_improvement`` — ``(median(LLM Sharpe) - best_baseline_central) / |best_baseline_central|``,
        a relative-Sharpe (Eureka-STYLE) normalised improvement on the central-tendency Sharpe;
      * ``beat_fraction_paired`` (SECONDARY, flagged) — the fraction of seeds where, AT THE SAME SEED
        INDEX, the LLM Sharpe beats the best-per-seed baseline Sharpe. The seed index is NOT a paired draw
        across two DIFFERENT rewards (each reward induces its own trajectory), so this is reported only as
        a sensitivity, not the headline;
      * ``winner_dsr`` / ``best_baseline_dsr`` — the median-per-seed DSR comparison (consistent with the
        floor gate's robust winner-DSR), deflated by ``winner_n_trials`` (LLM) vs N=1 (baseline).

    Degrades gracefully to ``{"status": "skipped", "reason": ...}`` when the winner arm or all configured
    baselines are absent from ``records`` (e.g. the baseline stage was not run, or a records-only window).
