"""Pre-launch per-leg gates (R80/R82): author smoke + format-compliance baseline + the
behavioural contamination screen. One command per leg (or --all), verdicts archived as JSONL.

Usage
-----
    # everything, all legs (needs OpenRouter/Anthropic credit; ~\\$1-2 total):
    python scripts/leg_gates.py --all --out outputs/leg_gates

    # one leg, screen only:
    python scripts/leg_gates.py --leg deepseek-v4-pro --only screen --out outputs/leg_gates

Gates
-----
1. **smoke** — one real call through the leg's PINNED transport (provider/quant/reasoning/max
   tokens): proves the pin route is live and the key valid. Archives served model + cost.
2. **compliance** — N (default 10) authoring calls with the REAL frozen prompts on a stub
   interface block; scores the parse rate (``extract_reward_source`` succeeds AND the source
   defines ``def reward(``). This is the per-model FORMAT-COMPLIANCE BASELINE the
   authoring-reliability table is interpreted against (R82): identical prompts for every model —
   the same-exam principle — so failures here are the model's, not the prompt's.
3. **screen** — the behavioural CONTAMINATION screen (registered; a screen, not a proof): three
   probe families over anonymised numeric arrays — (a) SERIES CONTINUATION (memorization probe: a
   real-looking anonymised return window; any confident claim to recognise/continue the actual
   series is a flag), (b) IDENTIFICATION (must NOT name a specific asset/date/event for
   anonymised numbers; hedged refusal = pass), (c) SYNTHETIC CANARY (a fabricated distinctive
   sequence; claiming to recognise it = confabulation flag). Scored by conservative keyword
   rules; every response archived verbatim for human review. VERDICT: pass / flag (a flag routes
   to Tamer — the gate never silently drops a leg; the pre-declared fallback chain decides).

All calls ride the R83 advisory spend ledger. Offline testing: ``--transport-factory`` is a seam
(tests inject a fake); production builds from ``src.llm.legs`` + ``src.llm.client``.
