"""HEADLINE campaign driver — the Eureka post-loop, single-split (FINAL_PLAN 3.A, H Phase 3).

Purpose
-------
This is the real experiment whose numbers enter the dissertation. It turns the
DIRECTIONAL prototype (``scripts/run_prototype.py``) into the headline result by
running the FROZEN select-on-validation -> freeze -> test-once protocol
(PREREGISTRATION §5/§6/§7/§10) on the **single development/evaluation split**:

  - **development** train 2005-2014 / val 2015-2017 — search + selection live here ONLY.
  - **evaluation**  test 2020-2026H1 — the *sealed* leg, touched EXACTLY ONCE on the
    frozen winner, per campaign seed; embargo 21 trading days between splits.

The "Eureka post-loop" is four sealed stages per arm:

  1. **SEARCH**  — reuse ``run_prototype.run_arm`` on the DEVELOPMENT split at the
     search seed (the loop/search machinery, matched compute, archived per candidate).
  2. **SELECT**  — pick the arm's winner by **validation Deflated Sharpe** through the
     existing ``src.selection.fitness`` path (``analyze_results._winner`` reads the same
     ``metrics['val_fitness']``). Selection NEVER builds a test-window bundle.
  3. **FREEZE**  — persist the winner's ``reward_source`` + ``reward_source_hash`` with a
     ``frozen`` marker via ``src.io.results.write_run`` (replay-from-archive, audit C-2).
  4. **TEST**    — re-instantiate the FROZEN winner reward, build a **3-window** bundle
     (``make_env_builder(..., test_window=<2020-2026H1 [start,end)>, embargo=21)``),
     re-train via the trainer, and call ``bundle.test_returns(policy)`` EXACTLY ONCE per
     (arm, seed). One record per (arm, seed) carries ``val_fitness``, the realized
     per-step ``test_returns`` vector, ``per_period_pnl``, ``test_sharpe``, ``test_cvar05``.

Scope (frozen design)
---------------------
This implements ONLY the headline single-split campaign. The rolling walk-forward
folds (5y/1y/1y, ``config/inference.yaml: deferred_walk_forward`` — R43 — the frozen
scheme is single_sealed_split) and any
per-fold re-selection are DEFERRED — see the ``# TODO(Rank 2b)`` marker. We do NOT
invent a walk-forward validation-split scheme.

Testability (dependency injection)
----------------------------------
Every heavy collaborator is injectable so the post-loop is unit-testable WITHOUT real
SAC training or torch: ``run_winner_search`` takes an ``arm_runner``;
``evaluate_winner_on_test`` takes a ``trainer`` and ``env_builder`` (and a
``reward_builder`` for winner re-instantiation). ``tests/test_run_campaign.py`` drives
the whole post-loop on the synthetic panel with a FAKE trainer/policy.

Flags
-----
  --config        Campaign config (default config/campaign.yaml).
  --resume        Skip (arm, seed) test records already archived (idempotent).
  --arms          Comma list overriding the configured arms.
  --search-seed   Override the development-split search seed (default seeds[0]).
  --synthetic     Use the synthetic panel (no gold load) — for smoke/dev only.
  --dry-run       Tiny synthetic grid (1 LLM arm, 2 candidates, 1 seed) — gated smoke; never resumes.
  --no-shutdown   Accepted no-op (the auto-shutdown consumer was removed; the host is never powered off).

    The pre-registered H3 contrast (DEEP_H3 §1, canonical) is, *within the distributional arm*,
    iterative reflection (the headline: ``generations:6`` x ``candidates_per_gen:5`` = 30, reflect-on-best)
    versus a SINGLE-SHOT best-of-N control that spends the **same candidate budget** (``candidates`` = 30)
    in ONE generation with **no reflection** (``src/llm/loop.py``: ``generations==1`` never enters the
    reflection branch — every candidate is drawn from the INITIAL prompt). Winner selection is identical
    (best validation Deflated Sharpe) and the single-shot winner is re-run at the **same campaign seeds**,
    so the two conditions are a clean, like-for-like, matched-budget A/B.

    This mirrors the per-arm SEARCH -> SELECT -> FREEZE -> TEST flow of :func:`run_headline_campaign` for the
    one ``distributional`` arm, but archives to a SEPARATE root tree so the headline iterative winner is
    never overwritten and the analyze-H3 test (built separately) can load BOTH conditions:

      - ``<output_dir>/search_h3_singleshot/distributional/``  — the single-shot search candidates,
      - ``<output_dir>/frozen_h3_singleshot/distributional-winner/`` — the frozen single-shot winner,
      - ``<output_dir>/test_h3_singleshot/distributional/`` — the single-shot winner's 30 sealed test seeds.

    Matched-compute (DEEP_H3 §4): the single-shot search trains each candidate at the SAME ``agent_cfg``
    (``train_steps``/``buffer``) as the iterative headline, so the H3 contrast is not confounded by replay
    capacity (the R24 50k-buffer concern). ``trainer``/``arm_runner`` are injectable so the stage is
    unit-testable WITHOUT real SAC training or an LLM; defaults are the production factory / serial
    ``run_winner_search``. Resume-aware: a missing frozen single-shot winner triggers a fresh single-shot
    search; an existing one is loaded (no paid re-search), and per-(seed) test records already on disk are
    skipped. ``n_gpu > 0`` runs the TEST seeds across the device pool (science-neutral with serial).

    """Run the headline single-split campaign for ``arms`` and return a summary dict.

    ``n_gpu > 0`` runs the TEST leg (the 30 winner re-runs per arm) in PARALLEL across the device pool
    with manual recycling (``src.orchestration.test_leg.evaluate_winners_on_test_parallel``); this is
    science-neutral with the serial path (same records, same once-only touch, same numerics). Default
    ``n_gpu=0`` keeps the serial ``evaluate_winner_on_test``.

    ``run_h3_singleshot=True`` appends the H3 SINGLE-SHOT control (DEEP_H3 §1) AFTER the arms (+ baselines):
    the distributional arm re-searched at ``h3_singleshot_generations`` (=1) on the same candidate budget,
    selected/frozen/tested at the same seeds, archived to DISJOINT ``*_h3_singleshot/`` roots. It is
    report-only and wrapped in try/except so it can never sink the headline arms.

    ``min_candidates`` (C3b, ops audit 2026-07-02) overrides the winner-selection floor: by default
    (``None``) an arm may only SELECT/FREEZE once its search pool has resolved the FULL configured
    ``candidates`` budget (accepted records + ledgered sandbox failures — see :func:`select_floor_ok`);
    a positive value lowers the required pool for operator emergencies, and ``0`` disables the floor
    (dev/test only). The returned summary additionally carries ``all_arms_tested`` and ``exit_code``
    (C3a — 0 clean / 3 resumable-incomplete; :func:`campaign_exit_status`).

    This is the production path (real SAC training); it is GATED on the user and is not
    exercised by the fast suite. The unit tests drive the four stages directly with fakes.
