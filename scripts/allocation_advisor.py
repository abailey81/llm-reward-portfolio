"""The adaptive allocation advisor CLI — one command = the current optimal launch settings.

Usage (GO morning, or any time during the campaign):
    python scripts/allocation_advisor.py                       # live snapshot -> the plan
    python scripts/allocation_advisor.py --probe-age-hours 30  # age the U/V probe verdict
    python scripts/allocation_advisor.py --vram-per-training 2.8 --rate 700 \
        --remaining "tier403=6800,legs=3000"                   # canary-measured facts -> ETAs

Prints the PLAN (regime, chunk-tasks, search-lane pool, the exact --seed-pool-blocks string,
pack depths, ETAs) and appends the raw snapshot to outputs/myriad_telemetry.jsonl. Advisory
only: nothing is submitted, nothing is altered, priorities are never touched.
