"""Training-budget learning curve — choose the per-candidate step budget at the PLATEAU (under-training gate).

Why this exists
---------------
The campaign trains the fixed SB3-SAC for a per-candidate step budget that is *pre-registered* (audit
B-5): every arm gets the SAME budget, so the budget must be large enough that the agent has CONVERGED
on a representative reward — otherwise the headline H2 contrast measures *under-training noise*, not the
reward. The prototype budget (25k) was set from Phase-0 *timing* (minutes/run), never from a *convergence*
curve, and the prototype showed late-training critic explosions — so the budget was an unvalidated guess.

This tool produces the missing evidence: it trains the FIXED, explosion-fixed agent (PopArt
scale-normalization + the gated ``learning_starts``; src/agents/trainer.py) on a representative reward at a
ladder of budgets and records, for each, the held-out (validation) return and the critic-loss trajectory.
The operator reads the curve and sets the campaign budget at the knee — the smallest budget past which the
eval return has plateaued and the critic loss is flat/finite. It does **not** change any frozen config; it
INFORMS the (amendment-gated) choice of ``train_steps_per_candidate``.

What it is NOT
--------------
* Not a result that enters the dissertation — it is an engineering/convergence diagnostic on the MACHINERY
  (like ``scripts/smoke_test.py``), reported to justify the budget.
* Not the full study. Each 200k-step training is GPU-minutes and the four-budget ladder at several seeds is
  GPU-HOURS — this script BUILDS + smoke-tests the harness; the **operator runs the real ladder** on the
  campaign GPU (see ``--budgets`` / ``--seeds`` and the printed command in the dissertation notes).

Representative reward
---------------------
Default ``differential_sharpe`` (Moody-Saffell online Sharpe; ``src/baselines/rewards.py``) — a real
risk-adjusted, STATEFUL reward of the family the LLM authors, well-conditioned (no variance-floor blow-up),
so the curve reflects genuine optimisation progress rather than a degenerate target. Override with
``--reward <REWARD_CANON key>``.

Outputs (``--out-dir``, default ``outputs/tables``)
---------------------------------------------------
* ``learning_curve.json`` — per-(budget, seed) eval-IQM return, terminal + max critic loss, the subsampled
  critic-loss trajectory, and wall-clock; plus the per-budget seed-IQM summary.
* ``learning_curve.md``   — a human-readable table (budget | eval IQM | terminal critic | max critic | minutes).
* ``learning_curve.png``  — two stacked panels (eval-return vs budget; critic-loss-vs-step per budget) — the
  PLATEAU plot. Skipped automatically if matplotlib is unavailable or ``--no-plot``.

Flags
-----
  --budgets       Comma list of step budgets (default ``25000,50000,100000,200000``).
  --seeds         Comma list of seeds to average per budget (default ``0``; the campaign uses more).
  --reward        REWARD_CANON key for the representative reward (default ``differential_sharpe``).
  --synthetic     Use a synthetic panel instead of the real gold dev slice (default real).
  --end           Real-data slice end date (default ``2016-12-31`` — the dev TRAIN end, SPLIT C).
  --device        ``cpu`` | ``cuda`` | ``auto`` (default ``auto``).
  --out-dir       Output directory (default ``outputs/tables``).
  --no-plot       Skip the PNG (still writes json + md).
  --smoke         Tiny-budget self-test ({200,400}, synthetic, cpu, no plot) — the unit-test mode; NOT a curve.
