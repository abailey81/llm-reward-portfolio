"""EXHAUSTIVE PRE-TRAINING VALIDATION — the last gate before compute is committed.

WHY A NEW GATE, AND WHAT IT IS *NOT*
------------------------------------
``scripts/preflight.py`` already guards the HOST and the CONFIG MIRRORS (disk, RAM, VRAM, keys,
retry layer, freeze state, budget/model/generation mirrors) and ``scripts/freeze.py --check`` guards
the DESIGN-OF-RECORD hashes. Neither is duplicated here. What neither can see is the **science
path**: whether a registered claim has an executable route to a number, whether the sandbox actually
refuses bad code, whether the authors can author, and whether the run will record what the analysis
later needs. Those are the failures that do not announce themselves — they surface as a plausible
result computed from nothing.

THE DESIGN PRINCIPLE: EVERY CHECK MUST PROVE IT CAN FAIL
--------------------------------------------------------
This repository's own review history is unambiguous: **7 of 12 findings in the 2026-07-26 code
review were instruments reporting success while measuring nothing** — a contamination screen that
asked and learnt nothing, a Phase-0 gate that trained nothing, two timing instruments that clocked
warmup as training, an audit that pinned nothing. A validator is exactly that kind of instrument, so
a green validator that has never been observed to go red is worth nothing.

Hence ``--self-test``: every check is handed a KNOWN-BAD input and must return FAIL. A check that
cannot be made to fail is reported as NOT-FALSIFIABLE and the self-test exits non-zero. Run it in CI
and before every launch; a validator you have watched fail is a validator you can believe.

STRUCTURE
---------
Each check is a PURE function over explicitly-gathered inputs, so it is unit-testable with no disk,
no network and no GPU; the gatherers are separate and best-effort. Statuses are PASS / WARN / FAIL /
SKIP, where SKIP means "the input genuinely does not exist yet" and is never silently green.

Usage::

    python scripts/pretrain_validate.py                      # full gate, human-readable
    python scripts/pretrain_validate.py --strict             # WARN counts as failure
    python scripts/pretrain_validate.py --json               # machine-readable
