"""Auto-restart supervisor — keeps the ~2-week campaign alive unattended.

Runs the campaign as a child process — ``--resume`` is appended on EVERY launch, the first included
(M7: a supervisor restarted by the ONSTART task or the operator must never issue a fresh, re-billing
search) — and on a non-zero exit (crash / OOM / transient outage / power-loss recovery) relaunches it
(bounded retries + exponential backoff), logging each restart. A child that survived a healthy stretch
(> 30 min) resets the retry counter (M7: the budget stops crash LOOPS, not weeks of independent
transients). It stops on a clean exit (0), on the user's deliberate graceful shutdown, or once the
restart budget is spent. Because the engine's resume is idempotent and the search-replay cache replays
archived work, a restart never re-bills Opus or re-trains completed candidates — the supervisor only
pays for the lost in-flight unit. Pre-flight is run once up front (NO-GO aborts before any compute is
committed) at the MAX worker width found in the passthrough args (F13 — validate what will actually run).

Hard rails (ultrareview 2026-07-02): ``--no-resume`` in the passthrough args is REFUSED loudly (F4 —
20 auto-restarted fresh runs = full re-search re-billing + frozen-winner overwrite + sealed-leg
re-touch); child exit 2 (argparse/usage) is NON-restartable (F9 — the identical bad command line can
never succeed on relaunch); and ``--max-total-restarts`` is an ABSOLUTE lifetime cap that the healthy
reset never touches (F3 — a recurring fault inside one irreducible > 30-min unit would otherwise
restart forever, each cycle able to re-bill one LLM call).

The restart *decision* is a pure function (unit-tested in ``tests/test_supervisor.py``); the process loop is thin.

Run::

    python scripts/supervisor.py --gpu 2 -- --campaign-args here
    python scripts/supervisor.py --gpu 2 --max-restarts 20 --no-preflight
