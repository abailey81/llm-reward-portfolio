"""Phase 0 GATE smoke test (FINAL_PLAN H, Phase 0; MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN P2).

Purpose
-------
The hardware + software + plumbing gate that MUST pass before any heavy work (campaign).
It proves the fixed agents actually TRAIN on the real env, measures **minutes per 50k-step
run** (``m`` — the one unmeasured quantity every cost/time figure depends on), and finds the
laptop's concurrency knee.

What it verifies (acceptance criteria):
  1. The compute device (CPU / CUDA) and torch build are reported (NOT asserted == 4090:
     the prototype runs on this RTX-4050 laptop, and per the deep-research the SB3 [256,256]
     nets are CPU-bound, so the prototype uses CPU torch — the rented-4090 campaign uses CUDA).
  2. A REAL active-suffix slice (univ5, Split C; or a SYNTHETIC slice of identical shape) loads.
  3. ``PortfolioEnv`` instantiates with a trivial reward and steps cleanly.
  4. SB3 ``SAC`` builds and trains (ONLINE path) with a MEMORY-SAFE buffer
     (``buffer_size == steps`` — the 1e6 default would need ~15 GB RAM at the 1893-dim obs).
  5. sb3-contrib ``TQC`` builds and trains (ONLINE path).
  6. Per-algo wall-clock, steps/sec, extrapolated minutes/50k, and critic-loss start-vs-end.
     (Critic-loss start->end is REPORTED for the operator to eyeball, NOT asserted: over a
     ~3000-step smoke window SAC/TQC critic loss is noisy and not reliably monotonic, so the
     gate asserts only that the final loss is finite — see the GREEN criterion below.)

Exit status:
  GREEN  -> both algos train, final critic loss finite, m printed.
  AMBER  -> trains but with a caveat (e.g. one algo failed, or a non-finite loss).
  RED    -> a hard precondition failed (env won't build/step, neither algo trains).

Flags
-----
  --steps      Training steps per algo (default 3000).
  --synthetic  Use a synthetic slice of identical shape instead of a real slice.
  --device     'cpu' | 'cuda' | 'auto' (default 'auto' -> cpu unless CUDA available).
  --algos      Comma list from {sac,tqc} (default 'sac,tqc').
  --end        Real-data slice end date (default 2006-12-31 -> a fast ~2-year slice).
