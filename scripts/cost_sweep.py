"""Transaction-cost robustness sweep — RE-PRICE the frozen winners across `costs.grid_bps`.

Why this exists (the cost-robustness arm)
-----------------------------------------
`config/environment.yaml` declares ``costs.grid_bps = [0, 5, 10, 25, 50]`` but, before Rank
15, nothing consumed it: there was no ``cost_bps`` override on the env and no sweep harness, so
the **cost-robustness arm** — which stands in for the absent market-impact model and is the
viva cost defence — could not be produced. This module is that harness. It answers the key
robustness question (PREREGISTRATION §10 power-caveat companion; FINAL_PLAN cost note):

  **Does a tail-aware reward still win once you charge it more to trade — i.e. is the
  distributional arm's edge a genuine risk-shape effect, or merely an artefact of trading
  less at the headline 10 bps?**

It RE-PRICES the **FROZEN** winning policies WITHOUT retraining (CLAUDE.md: results replay
from the archive; the test leg is touched once). Two re-pricing paths, identical to ~1e-12
(``tests/test_cost_sweep.py``):

  1. **ANALYTIC (preferred).** The campaign persists each frozen-winner test path's per-step
     GROSS and TURNOVER (``metrics['test_gross']`` + ``metrics['test_turnover']``, Rank 15).
     Because the cost is charged AFTER the action is chosen (audit C-5), the realized gross
     and turnover do NOT depend on the cost level, so for any per-unit cost ``c`` (a fraction)
     the net series is exactly::

         net_c = gross - c * turnover,   c = bps * 1e-4

     No env, no policy, no retraining — a vectorised re-price of the sealed test path.
  2. **RE-ROLL (fallback / cross-check).** When a record lacks the decomposition (an older
     archive), and a ``panel`` + ``reward_builder`` + injected ``policy`` are supplied, the
     frozen policy is re-rolled through a ``cost_bps``-OVERRIDDEN ``PortfolioEnv`` (the new
     ``PortfolioEnv(..., cost_bps=c)`` / ``make_env_builder(..., cost_bps=c)`` plumbing). This
     is also what the consistency test exercises against the analytic path.

Output (the headline robustness TABLE)
--------------------------------------
``sweep_markdown`` renders the **winner-identity-vs-cost** table — which arm wins at each cost
level (by test Sharpe) AND every arm's Sharpe + CVaR-5% at each level — exactly the check that
the tail-aware reward does not win merely by trading less. One row per cost level.

This module reads results ONLY through ``src.io.results`` (audit C-1) and is import-light /
torch-free for the analytic path (so the fast suite covers it).
