# CAMPAIGN BACKUP - a second copy of the irreplaceable campaign archive, plus the node-side
# authoring evidence that lives ONLY on purge-eligible cluster Scratch.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-28, written mid-campaign).
# The driver supports mirroring behind a `--mirror` flag, and the twelve MODE-D lines were launched
# WITHOUT it. So `D:\llm_rp_archive_mirror` sat 540 h stale while the confirmatory campaign wrote
# 186+ records that cannot be regenerated: LLM calls are non-deterministic, so a lost record is lost
# science, not a re-run. The sentinel reported the staleness correctly; nothing acted on it.
#
# Restarting twelve running lines just to add a flag is the larger risk, so this backs the archive
# up from OUTSIDE the campaign instead. It touches nothing the campaign writes.
#
# APPEND-ONLY, DELIBERATELY. Robocopy `/MIR` would propagate DELETIONS into the backup - which is
# precisely the failure this guards against. On 2026-07-27 a recursive delete removed the licensed
# gold panel and 1,085 raw files; had a `/MIR` job run after it, the backup would have been wiped
# in the same stroke. `/E` without purge means the mirror only ever GROWS: a deletion upstream
# leaves the copy intact, which is the entire point of a backup.
#
# USAGE (background it and forget it):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\campaign_backup.ps1
# Stop it the same way everything else stops: create outputs\campaign_cluster\STOP_CAMPAIGN.
