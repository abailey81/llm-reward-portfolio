# MODE-D WATCHDOG - keeps all twelve supervised lines ALIVE for the length of the campaign.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-28, written during the launch itself).
# mode_d_supervisor relaunches its driver on any NONZERO exit. It does NOT relaunch on exit 0,
# because 0 means "line complete" -- and that is correct for a finished line. But the tiered path
# ALSO returns 0 from the C3 review-gate stop:
#
#     if out.get("awaiting_review"): ... return 0
#
# so a line that stops at the gate is indistinguishable, to the supervisor, from a line that
# finished. The supervisor logs "LINE COMPLETE" and exits, and that line is then dead for the rest
# of the campaign. It happened within the first hour: five leg lines started while a
# MYRIAD_KILL_INCIDENT was blocking submission, their units were therefore incomplete, the gate
# correctly read RED-execution-health, and all five lines exited permanently. Under R101 every model
# must climb the SAME ladder in lockstep, so a silently dead leg is not a delay -- it is a hole in
# the design.
#
# The watchdog restarts any line whose supervisor is gone. It deliberately does NOT clear a kill
# incident: that is a human decision by construction, and it is SAFE to restart lines while an
# incident stands, because the incident blocks SUBMISSION, not process startup. A restarted line
# under a live incident simply backs off again, which is exactly the intended behaviour.
#
# USAGE (background it and forget it):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\mode_d_watchdog.ps1
# Stop it the same way everything else stops: create outputs\campaign_cluster\STOP_CAMPAIGN.
