.SYNOPSIS
    Mirror the irreplaceable run archives to a second physical drive (engineering review 2026-07-02).

.DESCRIPTION
    The campaign archive (LLM-authored reward code, prompts, reflections, per-seed records) is the ONE
    artifact in this project that cannot be regenerated: results REPLAY from the archive (CLAUDE.md
    prime directive 6) because LLM calls are non-deterministic. Everything else — panels, configs,
    code — is reconstructible; the archive is not. Until 2026-07-02 it lived on a single drive with no
    redundancy: a C: failure mid-campaign would have destroyed the experiment.

    This script robocopy-mirrors the archive roots to D:\llm_rp_archive_mirror\ (a different physical
    disk). /MIR keeps an exact replica (adds+updates+deletes); /R:2 /W:5 bounds retries so a locked
    in-flight file never stalls the mirror (it lands on the next pass); /XD excludes the transient
    driver_status (heartbeats) + batches (reconstructible specs) dirs. Run it:
      * manually after any pilot completes;
      * during the campaign: every 6 h via the watcher loop or a scheduled task —
        schtasks /Create /SC HOURLY /MO 6 /TN LLMRewardArchiveMirror
          /TR "powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File <repo>\scripts\mirror_archive.ps1"
    I/O-light (incremental after the first pass); safe to run beside training (reads only), but the
    2026-07-02 exclusive-phase discipline still prefers the recycle boundaries.

.PARAMETER MirrorRoot
    Destination root on the second drive (default D:\llm_rp_archive_mirror).

.PARAMETER Force
    Override the shrink guard (m8). By default a source whose record.json count is SMALLER than the
    existing mirror's is SKIPPED (a shrunken/emptied source would otherwise propagate the loss into the
    backup via /MIR). Pass -Force to mirror it anyway — e.g. after a deliberate, verified prune.
