"""Pre-registration freeze (FINAL_PLAN Phase 1.E; punch-list Rank 9).

Purpose
-------
Lock the experimental design before any results are seen. The freeze is a GATE:
``PREREGISTRATION.md`` (the human-readable prose record) and
``config/preregistration.yaml`` (its machine-readable mirror) must agree on every
freeze-relevant field, Phase 0 must have passed, and only then is a single canonical
SHA-256 over the pre-registration artifacts AND the executed load-bearing configs
recorded as the immutable design hash.

The canonical hash
------------------
SHA-256 over the **LF-normalized UTF-8 bytes** of the hashed artifacts concatenated in a
FIXED, documented order (``norm`` = strip-BOM + CRLF/CR -> LF; ``strip_state`` = blank the
two MUTABLE ``frozen``/``freeze_hash`` lines so the hash is INVARIANT to the freeze act)::

    canonical_bytes = norm(PREREGISTRATION.md)
                      + b"\n" + strip_state(norm(config/preregistration.yaml))
                      + b"\n" + norm(config/inference.yaml)        # if present  ┐ _BOUND_CONFIGS
                      + b"\n" + norm(config/environment.yaml)      # if present  │ (executed knobs)
                      + b"\n" + norm(config/data.yaml)             # if present  ┘
                      + b"\n" + norm(config/arms.yaml)             # if present  ┐ _BOUND_TREATMENT
                      + b"\n" + norm(prompts/system.txt)           # if present  │ (the manipulated
                      + b"\n" + norm(prompts/initial_generation.txt) # if present┘  variable itself)

i.e. **prose, THEN the freeze-state-stripped prereg yaml, THEN the three bound configs, THEN the three
bound treatment files** (see ``_BOUND_CONFIGS`` + ``_BOUND_TREATMENT``) — each joined by a single ``\n``
(LF) record separator. The bound configs are the EXECUTED knobs the campaign reads (splits/embargo/
lookback/family); the bound treatment is the per-arm feedback spec + the two loaded prompts (the
manipulated variable's text, R62). Binding both stops the frozen DESIGN drifting from the IMPLEMENTED
design (critical-review 2026-06-20; treatment added 2026-06-28). A bound file absent on a minimal root is
skipped, so a two-file (prose + prereg-yaml) root still hashes — this module is the single definition of
that order; nothing else may re-define it.

The prose<->YAML gate (the assertion)
-------------------------------------
Both files are parsed and asserted to agree on the freeze-relevant fields:

  - seed count                         -> ``len(yaml['seeds'])`` vs the prose "5->30 / [0..29]"
  - ``inference.testing_family.m``     -> the union size (6) vs the enumerated member rows; the two
                                          co-primary IUT sub-families (H2-RA m=3, H2-Tail m=3; R25) must
                                          partition it, and every prose "m = <N>" must be a declared size
                                          ({3, 6}) so a stray "m = 9" still fails
  - ``inference.difference_tests``     -> each label has its prose anchor (R11 relabel)
  - ``inference.sesoi``                -> vs the prose "SESOI = 0.05 validation-DSR units"
  - ``inference.equivalence_margin``   -> vs the prose "symmetric TOST ... +/-0.05 DSR"
  - top-level ``cost_sweep.grid_bps``  -> vs the prose "grid_bps = [0, 5, 10, 25, 50]"

Any mismatch raises :class:`FreezeConsistencyError` with a clear message naming the field.

Phase-0 precondition
--------------------
The freeze REFUSES unless ``phase0_smoke_passed_log_id`` is set in the YAML (the smoke
GATE must have gone GREEN/AMBER first — CLAUDE.md keystone). A missing/blank marker raises
:class:`FreezePreconditionError`.

Modes
-----
  --check   Recompute the hash + re-run every assertion WITHOUT writing anything (CI/drift
            guard). Exit code 0 == consistent + Phase-0 met; non-zero on any drift/failure.
  (default) The real freeze (the write path): set ``frozen: true`` + ``freeze_hash`` in the
            YAML, append the hash + UTC + git SHA to ``docs/DECISION_LOG.md`` (the ADR-005
            slot), create a signed git tag ``prereg-v1.0`` (best-effort), and OpenTimestamp
            the hash (best-effort). This path is implemented but MUST be run only by the user.
