"""FIRST-SEED SANITY — "is what we're producing garbage?", answered in hours, not days.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The campaign banks its first statistical result at the 30-seed floor, ~2 days in. But most ways a
run goes WRONG are visible on the very first completed seed: a reward that crashes every step and
trains on the fallback signal, returns full of NaN, a policy parked in cash producing a flat line,
an absurd reward scale. Waiting two days to discover that wastes two days.

⚠ THIS IS NOT "BANKING A RESULT AT SEED 1"
------------------------------------------
There is no inference at n=1 — no effect, no interval, nothing to bank. What this does is check
that the MACHINE is producing sane output. That distinction is not pedantry, it is the whole
design: the pre-registration commits to a SINGLE confirmatory look at the pre-declared date, and
peeking at effects earlier is optional stopping, which would invalidate every p-value and interval
in the dissertation. `src/cluster/integrity.py` states the same rule for the C3 review gate:
"conditioning continuation on observed effects is optional stopping"; what a mid-run gate may
inspect is EXECUTION.

So this module is **EFFECT-BLIND BY CONSTRUCTION**:

* it NEVER reads ``val_fitness``, ``test_sharpe``, ``test_cvar`` or any per-arm performance value;
* it NEVER compares one arm against another;
* every check is a per-record execution-quality question whose answer would be the same whichever
  arm turned out to win.

``tests/test_first_seed_sanity.py`` enforces this: it runs the gate over two archives that differ
ONLY in which arm performs better and asserts the output is byte-identical. A gate that leaks the
effect would fail that test.

Usage::

    python scripts/first_seed_sanity.py outputs/campaign_cluster            # first seed present
    python scripts/first_seed_sanity.py outputs/campaign_cluster --seed 0
