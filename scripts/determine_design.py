"""Design Determination Pipeline (DDP) — resolve every campaign parameter to its METHODOLOGICALLY-CORRECT
value, by the right procedure for its class, and report freeze-readiness.

Why this exists (read this before "optimising" anything)
--------------------------------------------------------
This is a CONTROLLED experiment: the agent is a fixed instrument and the *feedback channel* is the only
manipulated variable. A system that searched parameters to MAXIMISE the headline result would be the garden
of forking paths industrialised — it manufactures false positives and is unpublishable (and it cannot even
help a corroborated-NULL headline). So the DDP never optimises for performance. It assigns each parameter to
one of four classes and determines it by that class's CORRECT criterion:

  * MEASURE   — optimise for ADEQUACY (a diagnostic plateau), not performance: B* (convergence), n_seeds
                (power), candidates (search saturation). These are the ONLY "tuned" parameters.
  * CALIBRATE — set ONCE, identically across arms, by a principled procedure on PRE-TEST data only:
                SESOI, embargo, multiplicity, the DSR trial count (λ was reclassified FIX — see its row).
  * FIX       — hold at sensible literature defaults, IDENTICAL across arms; tuning would CONFOUND the
                channel contrast: all SAC/LLM hyperparameters, learning_starts, PopArt.
  * REALISTIC — credible real-world values, not result-maximising: universe, lookback, costs, splits,
                delisting, the cash rate.

INVARIANT: nothing here touches the sealed test split (2020-2026). Determination uses train+val (or
pre-2017 sub-folds) only; the test is opened ONCE, post-freeze, for the confirmatory inference.

What it produces
----------------
``docs/DESIGN_DETERMINATION.md`` (+ a json) — for every material parameter: its class, the method that fixes
it, the current value, the determination status, and the evidence pointer. A FREEZE-READY verdict is emitted
when every MEASURE/CALIBRATE parameter is resolved (no PENDING / FIX_NEEDED). This table is the methods-section
justification ("every design parameter, the principled procedure that set it, and the evidence").

This module is a reporter/orchestrator: the heavy determinations live in their own engines
(``scripts/learning_curve.recommend_budget``/``project_campaign``, ``scripts/power_analysis``); the one engine
that lived nowhere — search-saturation — is :func:`recommend_candidates` here.
