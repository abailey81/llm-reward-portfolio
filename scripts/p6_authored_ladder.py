"""P6 pilot — the authored-winner convergence ladder ON MYRIAD (docs/PILOT_BATTERY_2026-07-11.md §P6).

Closes the R74 blind spot from the cluster side, fast: the frozen convergence dossier measured
budget-flatness on ONE hand-written reward (``differential_sharpe``); this array measures it on the
two ARCHIVED LLM-authored prototype winners, {100k, 200k, 400k} x CRN seeds {0,1,2} x 2 rewards
= 18 independent tasks — wall-clock ~= the slowest single task (~65 min at 400k on a V100) plus
queue wait, vs ~21 h serial on the laptop. The laptop ``learning_curve.py --reward-source`` ladder
runs the SAME (reward, budget, seed) grid concurrently: together they are a cross-substrate parity
exhibit, and they answer complementary questions — the laptop replicates the R74 dossier protocol
(held-out eval-IQM, comparable to the frozen curve); this array records the campaign's own
SELECTION metric (validation DSR ``val_fitness``), i.e. "would anything selection-relevant improve
past B*?" in the units that decide the campaign.

PARITY: every spec is built by the campaign's own ``assemble_cluster_inputs`` + ``_search_spec``
and executed on-node by the certified ``parallel.train_candidate`` via ``run_one`` — nothing is
reimplemented. Train/val windows only; the sealed test leg is read by nothing here. Keyless
(pass A / stub designer): the rewards are already authored.

Usage:
    python scripts/p6_authored_ladder.py --submit            # build 18 specs + jobscript, push, qsub
    python scripts/p6_authored_ladder.py --build-only        # local validation, no ssh
    python scripts/p6_authored_ladder.py --pull              # pull records + per-budget summary
