"""Emit the external-deposit bundle of the frozen pre-registration (the OSF timestamp artifact).

Why this exists
---------------
The pre-registration's credibility currently rests on a LOCAL SHA-256 + git history, which an
examiner cannot easily verify. Depositing the frozen design on OSF (or minimally a public, dated
GitHub release) gives a THIRD-PARTY timestamp the PDF can cite — converting "the null was
predicted in advance" from trust-my-repo into independently verifiable fact (audit 2026-07-02,
ADR-050 ultraplan). This script packages EXACTLY the hash-bound files (the same eight
``scripts/freeze.py`` hashes) + a manifest + deposit instructions, so the deposit is one upload.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/make_prereg_bundle.py            # -> outputs/prereg_bundle_<hash8>.zip
    python scripts/make_prereg_bundle.py --out X.zip

Run it AT FREEZE TIME (after ``scripts/freeze.py`` writes ``frozen: true``): the bundle embeds
the canonical hash + the recorded freeze state, and the README tells the operator how to deposit.
Running pre-freeze is allowed for a dry-run (the README then carries a loud PRE-FREEZE banner).
