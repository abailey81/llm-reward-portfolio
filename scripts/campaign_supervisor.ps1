# CAMPAIGN SUPERVISOR (2026-07-18) — makes any driver death SELF-HEALING.
#
# WHY: the 2026-07-17 VPN outage killed both laptop drivers after their bounded ride-out
# (loud + resumable BY DESIGN — but a human had to notice). During the real campaign a
# night-time outage would stall authoring/requeues until morning. This wrapper relaunches
# the driver on ANY nonzero exit: the driver is idempotent (archive-truth resume; the P12
# lock auto-breaks for a dead owner; ledger-resubmit never re-bills authored candidates),
# so relaunching is always safe. Running arrays on Myriad are NEVER affected by a driver
# death — only the laptop-side loop stalls, and this closes that gap.
#
# USAGE (from the repo root, after the freeze — the P19 gate applies on every relaunch):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\campaign_supervisor.ps1
# Stop deliberately: create the file outputs\campaign_cluster\STOP_CAMPAIGN (checked
# between attempts), or Ctrl+C the supervisor itself.

# $cpuLane; read that file's header for the justification of each one.
