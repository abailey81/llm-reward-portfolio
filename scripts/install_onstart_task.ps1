.SYNOPSIS
    Register a Task Scheduler ONSTART task that re-enters the campaign after ANY reboot (ops audit C2).

.DESCRIPTION
    A 2-3-week unattended laptop run WILL see a reboot the operator did not schedule (Windows Update,
    power loss, a driver bluescreen). Without re-entry, the run silently stays down until a human
    notices — potentially days of lost wall-clock. This script registers a scheduled task that fires
    AT SYSTEM STARTUP and relaunches `scripts\supervisor.py -- <campaign args> --resume`:

      * the supervisor runs preflight, then keeps the campaign alive (bounded restarts + backoff);
      * `--resume` (also auto-appended by the supervisor itself, M7) makes re-entry idempotent —
        archived candidates/seeds replay from disk, so a reboot never re-bills the paid author;
      * stdout/stderr are appended to outputs\campaign\onstart_task.log for post-hoc forensics.

    OPERATOR-RUN ONLY — nothing in the campaign invokes this. Run it ONCE from an elevated PowerShell
    on run day (see docs/CAMPAIGN_RUNBOOK.md §0), and remove it with scripts\uninstall_onstart_task.ps1
    when the campaign completes (otherwise every future boot relaunches the supervisor; that relaunch
    is harmless — a finished campaign resumes to a no-op and exits 0 — but it is noise you don't want).

    The task runs as the CURRENT user (the .env key + the venv live in this profile) with highest
    privileges, whether or not the user is logged on (S4U logon: no password stored), with a 2-minute
    startup delay so CUDA/network services are up before training starts.

.PARAMETER TaskName
    Scheduled-task name (default: LLMRewardCampaignResume).

.PARAMETER CampaignArgs
    Argument string passed to run_campaign.py AFTER the supervisor's `--` separator. Default is the
    runbook's laptop headline invocation. `--resume` is appended by the supervisor regardless.

.PARAMETER SupervisorGpu
    n_gpu handed to the supervisor's preflight gate (default 2).

.PARAMETER Myriad
    Register the CLUSTER-driver resume task instead of the laptop one: the supervisor child becomes the
    Myriad driver (scripts\run_campaign_cluster.py), the laptop GPU clock lock is SKIPPED (the laptop
    GPU is idle — training is 100% on Myriad), and the supervisor's laptop-GPU preflight is bypassed
    (--no-preflight; the cluster's own G1 cert is the preflight). Use this for the 100%-Myriad campaign.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install_onstart_task.ps1                 # laptop
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install_onstart_task.ps1 -Myriad         # cluster
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\uninstall_onstart_task.ps1   # after the run

    # == D21 (2026-08-01, RUN 10): RE-ENTER THE FLEET, NOT ONE CAMPAIGN PROCESS ==================
    #
    # THE GAP. `Get-ScheduledTask` filtered on this repo returned NOTHING on 2026-08-01: this task
    # was never registered for RUN 4. A Windows Update reboot -- over a 26-day run, not a remote
    # possibility -- would have killed all 12 supervisors, 24 drivers, the watchdog, the cycle loop,
    # the publisher and the backup, and NONE of them would have come back, while the Myriad arrays
    # kept running and finishing with nobody polling, pulling or submitting the next generation.
    #
    # AND THE BRANCH BELOW WOULD NOT HAVE FIXED IT. It re-entered ONE `run_campaign_cluster.py`
    # with a hand-typed argument vector, which had already drifted from the live fleet in THREE
    # independent ways:
    #   * `--batch-tag c1`            -> the CORE LINE ONLY; the other ELEVEN lines stay down;
    #   * `--pack 4`                  -> the live fleet runs `--pack 8` (record s.58);
    #   * `--exclude-hosts node-d00a-230` -> MISSING `node-d00b-024`, i.e. the substrate fence.
    #     That is the D15 defect on the reboot path, and it is the worst of the three: it silently
    #     re-opens the CPU-model inhomogeneity that already cost four archived records.
    #
    # THE FIX IS NOT TO CORRECT THOSE THREE LITERALS -- IT IS TO DELETE THEM. Duplicating the
    # launch vector is what produced all three drifts, and a fourth would appear the next time the
    # fleet's shape changed. `mode_d_launch.ps1` starts the twelve supervised lines and returns;
    # `mode_d_watchdog.ps1` then keeps them alive and blocks, which is exactly what a Task
    # Scheduler action should hold open. Both now carry `-ExcludeHosts` (D15, same commit), so the
    # fence survives a reboot for the first time.
