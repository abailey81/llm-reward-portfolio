# MODE-D LAUNCHER (2026-07-21) - the maximum-parallel campaign: TWELVE supervised driver lines
# at once (the Opus core + the H3 floor unit + all 10 replication legs), each with its own log.
#
# WHAT MODE D IS (runbook s.10): every line submits from L+0; the SGE priority ladder - core
# search/floor/tier-100 highest, legs -200..-290 in the registered queue order, tier-189+ blocks
# from -300 - makes the scheduler enforce the registered unified queue natively, so completion
# and truncation order are EXACTLY the pre-declared ones while the eligible backlog stays deep
# enough to harvest every idle window. Search waves run pack-2 (latency lane); bursts pack-5
# (throughput lane); C4 rungs are pipelined. All ops-only: no registered quantity changes (R88).
#
# USAGE (after the v2 FREEZE + on Tamer's explicit LAUNCH word - never before):
#   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\mode_d_launch.ps1
# Stop everything: create outputs\campaign_cluster\STOP_CAMPAIGN (all lines check it).
# Monitoring: bash scripts/campaign_monitor.sh + the sentinel watch the shared mirror as usual;
# per-line logs at outputs\campaign_cluster\supervisor_<line>.log.

    # RUN GENERATION (2026-07-28). RUN 1 was invalidated by the cross-line reject-marker collision
    # (docs/CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_RECORD.md s.11.2). A clean re-execution needs a fresh archive on
    # BOTH sides - the local mirror AND the Scratch working root, because the halted run's jobs
    # keep archiving remotely for hours and archive-truth resume would adopt their records.
    # Defaults reproduce RUN 1's paths exactly, so an unparameterised call is unchanged.
    # RUN 2 is launched as:
    #   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\mode_d_launch.ps1 `

    # live processes happened to be started with it BY HAND. A clean relaunch from this script
