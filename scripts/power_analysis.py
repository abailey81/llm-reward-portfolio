"""Statistical power analysis for the HEADLINE H2 test (FINAL_PLAN B-5; viva Q21; PREREGISTRATION §10 R12/R16).

Purpose
-------
Compute the design-time power numbers that justify the campaign size and write them into
``docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md``. This runs BEFORE the Phase-1 freeze so the pre-registered design is
defensible: if the headline H2 returns a non-rejection, we report it as a **bounded effect** (an
effect smaller than the minimum detectable effect, MDE, AND — if the TOST CI is inside the SESOI —
practically equivalent), rather than an underpowered failure.

The REALIZED headline test this powers (the fix — R16)
------------------------------------------------------
The frozen inference (``config/preregistration.yaml: inference.difference_test_unit =
per_seed_iqm_paired_seed_bootstrap``; PREREGISTRATION §10 amendment R16) is, EXACTLY:

  * Each per-arm winner is re-run at ``n_seeds`` training seeds (Amendment D2: ``n_seeds = 30``).
  * Each seed's frozen-winner TEST return series is reduced to ONE per-seed score — the annualised
    Sharpe (the headline H2-conjunction leg, R13) or the CVaR at the tail level (the tail leg).
  * The per-seed scores are reduced to an **rliable IQM** point estimate per arm (Agarwal et al.
    2021) and compared by ``src.inference.bootstrap.paired_seed_difference_test(a, b,
    statistic=iqm, ...)`` — a re-centred basic empirical bootstrap that **resamples the shared
    training-seed indices** (paired across arms; the across-seed/training-RNG variance is carried,
    the common variance cancels) — consuming **exactly ``n_seeds`` paired per-seed scores**.

So the realized resampling unit is **seeds-on-per-seed-scores** and the sample size is ``n_seeds``
(30), **NOT** ``seeds x folds x N_regimes``. This module's power model is now faithful to that test:
:func:`simulate_power` draws ``n`` correlated per-seed score PAIRS and rejects via the REAL
``paired_seed_difference_test`` (no re-implementation of the decision rule), so the size and the
small-``n`` conservativeness of the actual test are reproduced rather than approximated.

(The SUPERSEDED model this file used to implement — an unpaired, seed-AVERAGED-series block bootstrap
on ``n_eff = seeds x folds x N`` iid cells — overstated the realized degrees of freedom ~6x at N=6
and modelled a test that is no longer run. That is gone; the regime count ``N`` is still computed and
reported because it bounds the SECONDARY regime-stratified analyses, but it does **not** enter the
headline paired ``n``.)

The honest noise input σ_seed (DIRECTIONAL upper bound)
------------------------------------------------------
The relevant noise is the **seed-to-seed standard deviation of the per-seed score within an arm**
(``sigma_seed``). The clean campaign pilot (winners re-run at 30 seeds with the reward FIXED) does not
exist yet, so we anchor σ_seed on the only realized dispersion available: the prototype archive
(``outputs/prototype``). There, each SEARCH candidate is trained at 1 seed, so the **per-candidate
within-arm dispersion of the per-seed annualised Sharpe is ≈ 0.36** (pooled across arms; the headline
``distributional``/``scalar`` arms are 0.36/0.37; ``scripts/power_analysis`` derivation, reproduced in
``docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md``). This is a **DIRECTIONAL UPPER BOUND** on the true σ_seed for two reasons:
(1) it mixes reward-DESIGN variance (a different reward per candidate) WITH the 1-seed sampling
variance, whereas the campaign's σ_seed holds the reward fixed and varies only the seed; (2) it was
measured at 25k steps on the prototype's shorter validation window, not the campaign's 50k-step sealed
test leg. A larger σ_seed inflates the MDE, so the reported MDE is a **pessimistic (upper-bound) MDE**
on the σ axis — the realized campaign should detect at least as small an effect. ``DIRECTIONAL_SIGMA_SEED``
records this proxy; ``--sigma-seed`` overrides it with the clean pilot value when it exists.

External cross-check (Colas et al. 2019, "A Hitchhiker's Guide to Statistical Comparisons of RL
Algorithms", arXiv:1904.06979). For a two-sample comparison of central RL performance across seeds at
**80% power**, they report (their guidelines): standardized effect δ = |Δμ|/σ_pool of **δ=0.5 → N≈100,
δ=1 → N≈20, δ=2 → N≈5–10** (and a real SAC-vs-TD3 case needed N≈10–15 at δ≈0.93). Our paired test on
**N=30** seeds therefore lands its 80%-power MDE near **δ≈0.8–1.0 σ**, consistent with the simulated
table below. Colas also flags that the *two-sample* bootstrap is anti-conservative below N≈50; our test
is the **paired/one-sample** variant (it cancels the common across-seed variance), and the simulated
null rejection here is conservative (≤ the selection-aware α), not inflated — the small-``n``
conservativeness is reported, not hidden.

The pairing correlation ρ (swept; default conservative)
------------------------------------------------------
The paired test gains power when the two arms' per-seed scores are POSITIVELY correlated across the
shared seed (a "lucky" seed lifts both arms, so the paired difference has lower variance). The true ρ
is unknown pre-campaign, so :func:`simulate_power` takes ``rho`` and the design sweeps
ρ∈{0, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7}. The **default ρ=0 is conservative**: it assumes pairing buys NO variance
reduction, so the reported headline MDE is the WORST case over ρ; any real ρ>0 only shrinks it.

Null framing (pre-committed; PREREGISTRATION §10 R12)
----------------------------------------------------
A non-rejection of H2 is reported as **non-rejection = (the effect is bounded below the MDE at the
target power and Šidák-α) AND (the TOST 90% bootstrap CI for the per-seed-score difference lies inside
±SESOI, i.e. the arms are practically equivalent within ±0.05)**. Neither alone; both together turn a
null into a credible bounded-effect finding rather than an underpowered shrug. (Units caveat: the
frozen SESOI/TOST margin ±0.05 is specified in *validation-DSR* units — the selection metric — whereas
the difference TEST runs on the per-seed annualised Sharpe and on CVaR; the TOST helper here applies
the ±margin in the SAME units as the score arrays it is handed, so feed it the metric the equivalence
claim is about. This unit distinction is stated, not silently conflated.)

Sharpe ↔ validation-DSR reconciliation (T2.5)
--------------------------------------------
Because the MDE is in annualised-Sharpe but the SESOI is in validation-DSR, :func:`sharpe_mde_to_dsr`
maps the Sharpe-MDE into validation-DSR units via a documented CONSERVATIVE (upper-bound) Sharpe→DSR
ceiling (delta method on the PSR `Φ(z)` at its maximum-sensitivity point `z=0`, normal returns,
``ΔDSR_max = φ(0)·√(T−1)/√252·ΔSR_ann``; T = the validation track length). The doc reports the MDE in BOTH
units. The reconciliation makes the unit gap quantitative and pins the **INCONCLUSIVE branch**: at the
campaign's T≈756 the ceiling EXCEEDS 0.05, so a Sharpe non-rejection alone does NOT license a DSR
equivalence claim — only a TOST CI evaluated **in validation-DSR units** inside ±SESOI does; otherwise the
result is reported INCONCLUSIVE (not equivalence). See ``docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md``.

Flags
-----
  --target-power   Desired power (default 0.80; the doc table also reports 0.90).
  --alpha          Family significance level before the selection penalty (0.05).
  --sigma-seed     Seed-to-seed σ of the per-seed score within an arm (CLEAN PILOT INPUT). Omit to use
                   the flagged directional upper-bound proxy from the prototype (``DIRECTIONAL_SIGMA_SEED``).
  --rho            Pairing correlation across the shared seed (default 0.0, conservative).
  --sesoi          Smallest effect size of interest (FROZEN: read from config; PREREGISTRATION §10 R12).
  --equiv-margin   Symmetric TOST equivalence margin (FROZEN: read from config).
  --n-seeds        Override the per-arm winner seed count n_seeds (default: from config; headline 30).
  --n-regimes      Override the independent-regime count N (REPORTED only; bounds the secondary
                   regime-stratified analyses — it does NOT enter the headline paired n).
  --n-comparisons  Size of the selection-aware testing family (default: frozen m=6).
  --n-sims         Monte-Carlo simulations per effect-size grid point (default 2000).
  --n-boot         Bootstrap replications inside each simulated paired test (default 2000, the code
                   default of ``paired_seed_difference_test``).
  --effect-max     Upper end of the effect grid in σ_seed units (default 5.0 — at N≤5 the conservative
                   paired test needs δ≈3–4σ, Colas 2019, so the grid must extend there to locate an MDE).
  --effect-points  Number of grid points on the effect-size search (default 41).
  --val-track-length  Validation track length T for the Sharpe->validation-DSR MDE reconciliation (T2.5;
                   default 694 = the SCORED Split-C validation window 2017-03-30..2019-12-31 after the

                   pre-Split-C window). Maps the Sharpe-unit MDE into the SESOI's DSR units
                   (conservative ceiling) so the null framing is single-unit.
  --seed           RNG seed for reproducibility (default 0).
  --out            Output markdown path (default docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md).

    """Map an ANNUALISED-Sharpe MDE to a CONSERVATIVE (upper-bound) shift in validation-DSR units (T2.5).

    Why this exists. The power analysis reports the MDE in annualised-Sharpe units (the headline difference
    test's scale), but the FROZEN SESOI / TOST margin is **0.05 validation-DSR** units (the selection
    metric; PREREGISTRATION §10 R12). A non-rejection is only a *bankable bounded-effect* finding if the
    effect is small in the SESOI's units — so the two must be reconciled rather than compared across scales.

    The mapping (documented, defensible). The validation DSR is a Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio,
    ``DSR = Phi(z)`` with ``z = SR_pp * sqrt(T - 1) / sqrt(D)`` (Bailey & Lopez de Prado;
    ``src.inference.deflated_sharpe``), where ``SR_pp`` is the **per-period** Sharpe and
    ``D = 1 - skew*SR_pp + (kurt - 1)/4 * SR_pp^2`` the non-normality denominator. A small ANNUALISED Sharpe
    gap ``ΔSR_ann`` is ``ΔSR_pp = ΔSR_ann / sqrt(periods_per_year)`` per period, and by the delta method
    induces a DSR shift ``ΔDSR ≈ phi(z) * sqrt(T - 1) / sqrt(D) * ΔSR_pp``. The sensitivity ``phi(z)/sqrt(D)``
    is **maximised** at the benchmark (``z = 0`` ⇒ ``phi(0) = 0.3989``, DSR ≈ 0.5) and under normal returns
    (``skew = 0, kurt = 3`` ⇒ ``D = 1``), so the CONSERVATIVE CEILING — the largest DSR shift ``ΔSR_ann``
    can produce — is::

        ΔDSR_max = 0.3989 * sqrt(T - 1) / sqrt(periods_per_year) * ΔSR_ann

    This is an UPPER bound: it is exact at-the-money/normal and over-states ΔDSR elsewhere (where ``z != 0``
    or the returns are fat-tailed, ``phi(z) < 0.3989`` and ``D > 1`` both shrink it). Using the ceiling is the
    honest direction for the null framing — if even the *largest* DSR shift the Sharpe-MDE could cause is
    below the 0.05 SESOI, the Sharpe-MDE is unambiguously sub-SESOI in DSR units; if it EXCEEDS 0.05 (it does
    at T≈756: ΔDSR_max ≈ 0.18 ≫ 0.05), the two metrics probe DIFFERENT scales and a Sharpe non-rejection
    does NOT by itself license a DSR-equivalence claim — only the TOST CI in DSR units can (the INCONCLUSIVE
    branch; see ``docs/CAMPAIGN_power.md``).

    ⚠ STATISTIC / PAIRING (P2 reconciliation, 2026-07-01). This is the MEAN-difference TOST. The HEADLINE
    campaign equivalence is a DIFFERENT statistic: it is PAIRED (common-random-number seed pairing) on the
    **IQM** difference — ``scripts/analyze_campaign._iqm_tost`` — matching the headline difference test
    (``paired_seed_difference_test`` with ``statistic=iqm``). The two must not be silently swapped, so:

      * ``paired=False`` (DEFAULT) resamples ``a`` and ``b`` INDEPENDENTLY. Because it discards the
        across-arm seed pairing, its difference CI is (for positively CRN-correlated arms) WIDER than the
        paired CI, so it is a **CONSERVATIVE, POWER-ANALYSIS-ONLY helper** (the sensitivity/planning TOST in
        this module's power tables) — it should NOT decide the headline equivalence.
      * ``paired=True`` resamples a SHARED seed index for both arms (CRN pairing), so the mean-difference CI
        carries the across-seed covariance exactly like the headline. Use this whenever ``a``/``b`` are
        genuinely paired per-seed scores (e.g. the order-preserving Sharpe→DSR rescale in
        ``analyze_campaign.h2_tost_dsr``). Requires ``a.shape == b.shape``.

    The headline equivalence VERDICT always routes through the paired+IQM ``_iqm_tost``; this MEAN TOST is
    the conservative complement (mean vs IQM) and the power-analysis planning tool.

    Declares the two arms *practically equivalent* when a two-sided ``1 - 2*alpha`` (90%) percentile
    bootstrap CI for the mean difference falls **entirely within** ``(-margin, +margin)`` — the TOST rule
    (the 90% CI inside ±SESOI ⇔ both one-sided tests reject; Lakens 2017). A non-rejection of H2 *plus* a
    TOST equivalence verdict lets the dissertation report "distributional and scalar are equivalent within
    ±``margin``" — a bounded effect, not "we found nothing" (PREREGISTRATION §10 R12; viva Q21).

    UNITS. ``margin`` is applied in the SAME units as ``a``/``b``. The FROZEN SESOI/TOST margin ±0.05 is
    specified in *validation-DSR* units (the selection metric), so for a DSR-space equivalence claim feed
    per-seed DSR; the headline difference TEST runs on per-seed Sharpe/CVaR, which are a different scale —
    do not conflate them (see the module docstring). Lakens 2017: equivalence bounds should be set on the
    RAW scale, not a standardized (Cohen-d) scale, to avoid bias.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b:
        Per-seed scores for the two arms (one value per training seed).
    margin:
        Symmetric equivalence margin (the SESOI), in the units of ``a``/``b``. Must be positive.
    n_boot:

    rng:

**Purpose.** Decide whether the planned design can detect a realistic H2 effect before spending compute,
and be honest in the dissertation about how much power the test has. A non-rejection of H2 is reported
as a **bounded effect**, NOT an underpowered failure — see "Pre-committed null framing" below. Committed
before the Phase-1 freeze; re-run with the clean seeds-on-winners pilot σ to finalise the TBD fields.

## The test this powers (the realized headline — PREREGISTRATION §10 R16)
The frozen inference unit is `per_seed_iqm_paired_seed_bootstrap`. Concretely: each per-arm winner is
re-run at **n_seeds = {cfg.seeds}** training seeds; each seed's frozen-winner TEST series is reduced to
one per-seed score (the **annualised Sharpe** for the H2-conjunction leg, R13; CVaR for the tail leg);
the per-seed scores are reduced to an **rliable IQM** (Agarwal et al. 2021) and compared by
`src.inference.bootstrap.paired_seed_difference_test(a, b, statistic=iqm)` — a re-centred basic empirical
bootstrap that resamples the **shared training-seed indices** (paired across arms), consuming exactly
**n_seeds = {cfg.seeds}** paired per-seed scores. The realized sample size is therefore **n_seeds, NOT
seeds × folds × N_regimes** — this analysis was re-derived against that test (the superseded
seed-averaged-series model that inflated the effective n ~6× is retired). `simulate_power` rejects via
the SAME `paired_seed_difference_test`, so the simulated size + small-n behaviour are the real test's.

## MDE definition
Δ_MDE is the smallest true per-seed-score gap Δ (distributional − scalar, in annualised-Sharpe units)
at which the realized rliable paired test (`paired_seed_difference_test`, IQM statistic) rejects H0 with
probability ≥ **target power = {cfg.target_power:.2f}**, at the per-test alpha of the PRIMARY rule (α = {a_eff:.4f}):

    Δ_MDE = min {{ Δ ≥ 0 : Power(Δ | n_seeds = {cfg.seeds}, σ_seed = {_fmt(cfg.sigma_dsr)}, ρ = {cfg.rho:.1f}, α = {a_eff:.4f}) ≥ {cfg.target_power:.2f} }}

estimated by Monte-Carlo ({cfg.n_sims} sims/grid-point, {cfg.n_boot} bootstrap reps/test) over the REAL test.
For the power simulation the bootstrap two-sided p is converted in-direction (p_one = p_two/2 when the
effect is in the predicted direction) — a symmetric-DGP approximation to the headline R64 direct upper-tail
rule (`pvalue_one_sided_greater`), exact here because the simulation draws symmetric (normal) pairs. The conservative Šidák-over-m figure
(`alpha_eff = 1 − (1 − {cfg.alpha:.2f})^(1/{cfg.n_comparisons}) = {sidak_a:.4f}`) is the BH-over-6 SENSITIVITY below.
{sidak_section}
## Pairing-correlation (ρ) sensitivity — headline MDE table
The paired test gains power as the two arms' per-seed scores correlate across the shared seed (ρ>0
cancels the common "lucky-seed" variance). ρ is unknown pre-campaign, so we sweep it; the **default ρ=0
is the conservative worst case** (no cancellation), and any real ρ>0 only shrinks the MDE. The ρ-sweep
table uses the PRIMARY decision rule above.

{rho_table}

{sigma_seed_section}

**External cross-check (Colas et al. 2019, arXiv:1904.06979).** For comparing central RL performance
across seeds at 80% power they report δ=0.5 → N≈100, δ=1 → N≈20, δ=2 → N≈5–10 (δ = |Δμ|/σ_pool; a real
SAC-vs-TD3 case needed N≈10–15 at δ≈0.93). At our **N={cfg.seeds}** the simulated 80%-power MDE is ≈ {_fmt(mde_sig, 2)} σ_seed
(δ≈{_fmt(mde_sig, 2)}), squarely in that envelope. Colas flag the *two-sample* bootstrap as anti-conservative
below N≈50; ours is the **paired/one-sample** variant (it cancels the common variance) and the simulated
null rejection is ≤ alpha_eff (conservative), not inflated — see the power curve's effect=0 row.

## Sharpe ↔ validation-DSR reconciliation (T2.5)
The MDE above is in **annualised-Sharpe** units (the difference test's scale), but the FROZEN SESOI / TOST
margin is **{_fmt(cfg.sesoi)} validation-DSR** units (the selection metric). These were never reconciled — a
Sharpe-MDE of {_fmt(mde_val)} and a DSR-SESOI of {_fmt(cfg.sesoi)} are not directly comparable. We close that
gap with a **documented, conservative (upper-bound) Sharpe→DSR map** (`sharpe_mde_to_dsr`).

The validation DSR is a Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio `DSR = Φ(z)`, `z = SR_pp·√(T−1)/√D`, with `SR_pp` the
**per-period** Sharpe and `D = 1 − skew·SR_pp + (kurt−1)/4·SR_pp²` (Bailey & López de Prado;
`src/inference/deflated_sharpe.py`). An annualised gap `ΔSR_ann` is `ΔSR_pp = ΔSR_ann/√{PERIODS_PER_YEAR}`
per period and, by the delta method, shifts the DSR by `ΔDSR ≈ φ(z)·√(T−1)/√D·ΔSR_pp`. The sensitivity
`φ(z)/√D` is **maximised** at the benchmark (`z=0 ⇒ φ(0)=0.3989`, DSR≈0.5) and under normal returns
(`D=1`), giving the conservative **ceiling**

    ΔDSR_max = 0.3989 · √(T−1) / √{PERIODS_PER_YEAR} · ΔSR_ann      (T = {val_track_length} scored sessions; the frozen Split-C validation window 2017–2019, first scored day ~2017-03-30 after the 60-session purge — the old "[2015,2017]" label was the superseded pre-Split-C window, 2026-07-05).

Plugging the headline MDE: {dsr_mde_clause}{(" The 90%-power Sharpe MDE maps to ≈ " + _fmt(dsr_mde90) + " validation-DSR (ceiling).") if dsr_mde90 > 0.0 else ""}

This ceiling is an UPPER bound (exact at-the-money/normal, smaller elsewhere: off-benchmark `z≠0` or fat
tails both reduce it). It is the honest direction for a null: if even the *largest* DSR shift the Sharpe-MDE
could cause is ≤ the {_fmt(cfg.sesoi)} SESOI, the Sharpe-MDE is unambiguously sub-SESOI in DSR units. At the
campaign's T≈{val_track_length} that ceiling **exceeds** the SESOI, so the Sharpe difference test and the
DSR SESOI **probe different scales** — which is exactly why the INCONCLUSIVE branch below is load-bearing and
the TOST equivalence must be evaluated **in DSR units** to license a bounded-effect (equivalence) claim.

## Pre-committed null framing (PREREGISTRATION §10 R12; viva Q21)
A non-rejection of H2 is reported as a **bounded effect**, defined as the conjunction:

> **non-rejection ⇔ (the H2 effect is bounded BELOW the Δ_MDE above, at {cfg.target_power:.0%} power and the
> Šidák per-test alpha) AND (the TOST 90% bootstrap CI for the arm difference lies INSIDE ±{_fmt(cfg.equiv_margin)}
> *in validation-DSR units*, i.e. the arms are practically equivalent within the SESOI).**

Both conditions, not either alone: the MDE bound says "any real effect is smaller than Δ_MDE"; the TOST
verdict says "and it is small enough to be practically equivalent".

**The INCONCLUSIVE branch (explicit, T2.5).** Because the Sharpe-unit MDE maps to a DSR shift that EXCEEDS the
{_fmt(cfg.sesoi)} SESOI (the reconciliation above), a Sharpe non-rejection **does not by itself** license an
equivalence/bounded-effect claim in the SESOI's units. Concretely:

> If H2 does not reject on the Sharpe difference test **and** the TOST 90% bootstrap CI (computed **in
> validation-DSR units**) lies INSIDE ±{_fmt(cfg.equiv_margin)} → report **bounded effect / practical
> equivalence**. If H2 does not reject but the DSR-unit TOST CI is **NOT** inside ±{_fmt(cfg.equiv_margin)}
> (or the DSR-unit TOST is not run) → report **INCONCLUSIVE** (underpowered for an effect this small in DSR
> terms), NOT equivalence (Lakens 2017). A Sharpe-only non-rejection is at most INCONCLUSIVE for the DSR
> equivalence claim.

*Units:* the frozen ±{_fmt(cfg.equiv_margin)} is in validation-DSR (the selection metric); `tost_equivalence`
applies the margin in whatever units it is handed, so feed it **per-seed validation-DSR** for the equivalence
verdict (do not conflate the DSR-scale SESOI with the Sharpe-scale difference test — stated, not silently
merged). The Sharpe→DSR ceiling above is what makes that unit gap quantitative rather than a caveat.

## Trial count (explicit)
Total candidates generated across all arms = **{n_trials}** (arms × candidates_per_arm, from
`config/campaign.yaml`). CPCV is applied to the *winners* afterward for inference (PREREGISTRATION §6),
not inside each candidate. This is the count stated for the Deflated-Sharpe deflation, with the
documented caveat that the *effective* trial count is ill-defined under guided search (DSR secondary).

## Method
1. Label regimes; count independent blocks (`independent_regime_count`). → N (reported; secondary only).
2. From the **seeds-on-winners pilot** (TBD), estimate σ_seed = seed-to-seed SD of the per-seed score
   within an arm. Until then use the prototype directional upper bound. → σ_seed.
3. Monte-Carlo: under a grid of true effects, draw n_seeds correlated per-seed score pairs (per-arm SD
   σ_seed, pairing ρ) and reject via the REAL `paired_seed_difference_test` at alpha_eff. → power curve.
4. Report Δ_MDE at {cfg.target_power:.0%} (and 90%) power across ρ∈{{0,0.3,0.5,0.7}}; if the budget does not
   reach it, say so and record that the contribution may rest on a rigorous null + a TOST equivalence bound.
5. TOST: a 90% bootstrap CI for the arm score difference inside ±margin ⇒ practical equivalence.
