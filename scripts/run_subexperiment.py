"""Report-only mechanism sub-experiment driver (ADR-039; PREREGISTRATION §2a) — DEFAULT-OFF, DISJOINT.

Two registered sub-experiments that the confirmatory campaign does NOT run (they need a SEPARATE
re-authoring pass producing PAIRED reward sources). Both are report-only, never gate the frozen m=6
headline, and are produced here by a thin driver mirroring ``scripts/run_prototype.py``'s
load-panel-once + ``run_loop`` pattern:

  * ``--mode named``   — the NAMED-vs-BLINDED structural A/B. For each seed the SAME anonymised panel +
    base prompts are authored TWICE: condition ``named`` appends a DATA-PROVENANCE paragraph to the
    ``initial`` prompt (the real train-window calendar span, the real RIC tickers, the regime
    composition), condition ``blinded`` leaves the base prompt UNCHANGED. Each record is stamped with a
    top-level ``label`` in ``{"named","blinded"}`` so ``analyze_campaign`` pairs them by
    ``(generation, candidate_id)`` and runs ``named_vs_blinded_structural``.

  * ``--mode legible`` — the numeracy-bottleneck legible-format responsiveness differential. Condition
    ``legible`` renders the distributional tail block in basis-points + decile form
    (``legible_render=True``); condition ``raw`` renders the close-small-float vector
    (``legible_render=False``). Each record is stamped ``condition`` in ``{"legible","raw"}`` so
    ``analyze_campaign`` runs ``legible_format_responsiveness_differential`` over the two conditions.

Both conditions train the SAME fixed SB3-SAC agent (arm = ``"distributional"``) on the SAME anonymised
panel + windows the campaign uses, so the per-candidate arrays are byte-identical to the blinded leg —
the ONLY thing that differs is the feedback RENDERING (legible) or the appended provenance text (named),
exactly as the analysis legs require.

Pairing robustness (FLAG B). The named leg's ``named_vs_blinded_structural`` REQUIRES
``len(named) == len(blinded)`` with index-alignment by ``(generation, candidate_id)``. A sandbox
rejection in only ONE condition would desync the two lists. We resolve this on the DRIVER side, honestly
and at zero extra spend: after authoring both conditions we keep only the ``candidate_id``s ACCEPTED IN
BOTH conditions (the intersection) and DELETE the unpaired records from the archive before analysis reads
them (``_prune_to_intersection``). ``analyze()`` already sorts each leg by ``_by_generation``, so the two
pruned, equal-length lists align element-for-element. This is the no-extra-spend option: it discards a
handful of unpaired candidates rather than re-authoring to backfill them.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/run_subexperiment.py --mode named   --n-seeds 150 --candidates 5 --output-dir runs/named
    python scripts/run_subexperiment.py --mode legible --seeds 0..149 --candidates 5 --output-dir runs/legible
    python scripts/run_subexperiment.py --mode named   --n-seeds 4   --candidates 3 --synthetic   # smoke

The keyless stub designer (Pass A / ``--synthetic`` or no key) lets the WHOLE pipeline run without an API
key; the real Opus author (config/subexperiment.yaml: llm) is used otherwise. ~150-200 seeds give >0.95
power for the named A/B (src/inference/contamination.py:234) but the count is configurable (it costs Opus
calls), read from config/subexperiment.yaml unless overridden on the CLI.
