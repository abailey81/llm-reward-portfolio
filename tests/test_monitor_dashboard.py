"""Behaviour tests for the read-only watcher helpers in ``scripts/monitor.py`` (silent-hang detection,
the anomaly error-tracker, LLM token/cost accounting, and the alert payload).

The dashboard is strictly READ-ONLY over on-disk run artefacts, so these tests synthesise a tiny
``progress.json`` / ``events.jsonl`` / ``anomalies.jsonl`` and assert the pure logic — no rich, no torch,
no network (``post_alert`` is never called against a real URL).
