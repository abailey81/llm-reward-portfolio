"""The junction-safety lock — written because the unsafe version DESTROYED the data directory.

On 2026-07-27 `certify_commit` junctioned the real `data/` into a throwaway worktree and tore the
worktree down without severing the link. A Windows junction is not a symlink, the teardown followed
it, and the REAL directory was deleted: 1,179 tracked files (restored from git) and ~1.2 GB of
untracked data including the gold panel, which is not in git.

⚠ The incident note blamed `shutil.rmtree`. Measured here (Python 3.11.9 + Git for Windows), that is
WRONG: CPython treats a junction as a link and will not descend it, whether you rmtree the junction
itself or a parent containing one. `git worktree remove --force` DOES follow it, and that is what
destroyed the data — see `test_git_worktree_remove_follows_a_junction_and_destroys_the_target`,
which reproduces the loss so the guard's rationale matches the hazard it actually guards.
