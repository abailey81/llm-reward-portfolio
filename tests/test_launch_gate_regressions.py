"""THE 2026-07-27 LAUNCH-GATE REGRESSION LOCKS.

Every test here pins a defect found on the day of the confirmatory launch, in code that the full
suite (2,779 passing) and every pre-launch gate had already certified green. They are collected in
one module because they share a single root cause worth naming:

    **a launch-time VALUE that no gate ever compared against its registered source.**

The freeze gate compares *config to pre-registration*. The suite compares *code to code*. Nothing
compared *the command line, the walltime, or the data path* to anything at all — so the roster
could say seven while the register said nine, the walltime could be sized off a GPU curve on a CPU
lane, and ``--gold-dir`` could point at an empty directory, with every instrument green.

Four of these would each, alone, have destroyed the campaign:

* ``autosize_h_rt`` granting 6 h to a training that needs 8.55 h -> every task SIGKILLed;
* ``_enforce_kill_switch`` reading those walltime deaths as an ADMINISTRATIVE kill -> the whole
  campaign hard-blocked behind an incident file only a human can clear;
* ``--gold-dir`` resolving to an empty directory -> every task dying in the loader;
* a seven-arm roster -> confirmatory node N4 permanently unsatisfiable.

The complementary locks in ``tests/test_run_campaign_cluster.py`` and ``tests/test_mode_d.py``
cover the same incident from the CLI and launcher sides.
