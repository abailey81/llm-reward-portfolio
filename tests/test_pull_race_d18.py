"""D18 — the pull must never nest a record inside itself, even when it loses a race.

Root cause found 2026-08-01 (RUN 10, record §100). §44.6 and §65.4 correctly identified the
DEFECT — one record at two paths, `<candidate>/<candidate>/record.json` — and left the MECHANISM
unstated, so it was carried for two sessions as "a destination computed as `<dest>/<run_id>`".

**The real mechanism.** `shutil.move(src, dst)` where `dst` is an EXISTING DIRECTORY does not
fail — it moves `src` INSIDE it. The `if dest.exists(): continue` guard cannot close that, because
`local_root` (`read_root`) is SHARED BY ALL TWELVE SUPERVISED LINES: another line's driver can
commit the same record in the window between our check and our move.

**Three independent facts confirm it, and none of them is an inference:**
  * the remote side is FLAT — verified on the node, no nesting exists there, so the doubling is
    created locally by the pull;
  * both live instances sit on LEG lines, i.e. the many-concurrent-drivers case;
  * the count grew 1 -> 2 as concurrency rose (1,025 records -> 1,449 -> 1,597).

`os.rename` is the fix because it CANNOT nest: renaming onto an existing directory raises rather
than descending into it. Same filesystem by construction (staging is a child of the mirror), so it
is atomic too.

**Impact was bounded and is stated honestly:** both duplicates are byte-identical, both sit on
report-only legs, and — verified first-hand rather than assumed — NEITHER the C3 gate nor the
completeness census can be misled by one, because the gate counts DISTINCT substrate signatures
(a duplicate adds to an existing one) and `_test_census` builds a SET of `run_id`s.
