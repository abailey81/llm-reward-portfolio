    `scripts/analyze_campaign.py` emits an `iut_block` for node N6 (H1 dominates the hand-reward

    ``"registered_pending_supervisor_ratification"`` for a day after **R108 (2026-07-26)** recorded

    Nothing branches on the field, so no computed number was wrong — but a replay-only campaign
    would have archived a result that describes its own CONFIRMATORY node as un-ratified, and the
    write-up reads that archive. Same stale-fact class as #84, which was reconciled across `paper/`
    and `PREREGISTRATION.md` but not across `scripts/`.

    Guards the AGREEMENT, not a literal string, so ratification state may change freely provided the
