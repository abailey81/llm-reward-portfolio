"""Assembly of the six confirmatory node p-values + the ratified graphical verdict.

Companion to tests/test_graphical_alpha.py: that tests the RULE, this tests the BRIDGE from
analyze_campaign's result dict to it (write-time registry row 36).

The fixtures below mirror the REAL shapes, each verified against the producing code — h2's
legs/tail_legs, h3's nested "difference", h4's "tests", h2_structure's "cvar" sub-result, and
h1_beat_human's precomputed "iut_pvalue" with its all_baselines_present gate. That verification
mattered: 4 of 6 first-guess paths (taken from docstrings) were WRONG.
