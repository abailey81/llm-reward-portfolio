"""D16 — the C3 review gate must SEE a substrate mix, not just a device-label mix.

THE DEFECT (found 2026-07-30, applied 2026-08-01, record §97). ``write_integrity_report``'s
``health_ok`` is the ONLY field the review gate reads, and its stop message claims it fires on
"device inhomogeneity". It was computed from ``crn_pair_device_consistent``, which keys on the
cpu/cuda LABEL — so on a CPU-only lane every record looks identical to it. The one inhomogeneity
that actually occurred in RUN 4 — four ``baseline_volatility_scaled_return`` records on an Intel
Xeon Gold 6140 against 26 on a Gold 6240 — passed the gate silently, while the ADVISORY sentinel
(``check_substrate_fields``) rated the same thing CRITICAL.

WHY THESE TESTS FAIL AGAINST THE PRE-FIX CODE (the requirement that makes them worth having):
``test_substrate_mix_at_a_shared_seed_fails_the_gate`` builds two units whose records at the SAME
seed carry DIFFERENT ``cpu.model_name`` and IDENTICAL device labels. Pre-fix, ``health_ok`` is True
because nothing consults ``env.json``'s cpu block; post-fix it is False. The three companions pin
that the fix did not simply make the gate stricter about everything: a homogeneous leg still passes,
a device-only mix still fails as it did before (no regression), and a missing ``env.json`` is a
WILDCARD rather than a failure — because a capture gap must not stop a line.
