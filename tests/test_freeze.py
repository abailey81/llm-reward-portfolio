"""FAST tests for the pre-registration freeze GATE (Rank 9, scripts/freeze.py).

These are import-light (no torch) and never run the REAL freeze. They pin the load-bearing
guarantees of the gate:

  - ``--check`` PASSES on the CURRENT, consistent prereg: the hash computes, the
    prose<->yaml assertion holds on all six frozen fields, and the Phase-0 precondition is met;
  - the prose<->yaml assertion RAISES on a deliberately-mismatched fixture (yaml sesoi 0.05 vs
    a prose 0.20; an m mismatch; a seed-count mismatch);
  - the Phase-0 precondition RAISES when the marker is absent/blank;
  - the canonical hash is DETERMINISTIC (same inputs -> same digest) and ORDER-SENSITIVE
    (swapping prose<->yaml changes it) and LINE-ENDING invariant (CRLF == LF);
  - ``--check`` does NOT mutate any file (frozen stays false, freeze_hash stays null).

The mismatch / precondition / write-path cases operate on a COPY of the two real artifacts in
``tmp_path`` (via ``freeze.<fn>(root=...)``), so the live PREREGISTRATION.md /
config/preregistration.yaml are never edited by the suite.
