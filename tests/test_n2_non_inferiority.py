"""A16 — validity-tier node N2 reads the REGISTERED non-inferiority rule, plus its sensitivities.

The defect these tests pin
--------------------------
``config/preregistration.yaml`` registers N2 as ``{test: h2_ra_iut_or_tost, equivalence:
tost_0.05_dsr}`` and its own dated note says "activation rests entirely on N2 rejecting via TOST — a
real pre-registered alpha source". ``validity_tier.NODE_SOURCES`` read ``pvalue_one_sided`` — the
SUPERIORITY leg only — so the registered disjunction had no implementation. Under the design's own
predicted branch that left ALL SIX confirmatory nodes unreachable.

``{theta > 0} UNION {-d < theta < d}`` IS ``{theta > -d}``: the registered disjunction is one
one-sided non-inferiority hypothesis at the SESOI. The repair is conformance to a frozen design.

Every test below fails against the pre-fix code: pre-fix there is no ``pvalue_non_inferiority`` key
anywhere, so N2 reports untestable and cannot reject.

Pre-specified 2026-08-01T13:01:15Z (HEAD 57c5ecc4) with 0 of 3 H2-RA legs computable — i.e. while no
H2 outcome existed — and posted to the lane bus before any of this was written.
