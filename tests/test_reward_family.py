    """#77: the H4 search box is TRIPLICATED, every copy claims to mirror the others, and nothing
    enforced it — on a CONFIRMATORY node.

    The three copies are ``config/prototype.yaml: reward_family.weights``,
    ``config/eureka_loop.yaml: reward_family.weights``, and
    ``src/baselines/reward_family._DEFAULT_BOUNDS``. Each carries a comment asserting the mirror
    ("mirrors eureka_loop.yaml", "Frozen ranges (mirror config/eureka_loop.yaml…)"), yet the only
    enforced eureka mirror in the repo is R97's ``baseline_rewards``
    (``tests/test_baselines.py::test_secondary_panel_config_matches_reward_canon``).

    Why it matters: H4 is the beat-the-max IUT — free-form LLM code versus the BEST member of this
    fixed parametric family. The BOX defines what "best member" means, so drift silently redefines the
    comparator and hence the H4 verdict. And the LIVE source is NOT the documented one: every campaign
    consumer reads **prototype.yaml** (``run_campaign.py:674``, ``run_campaign_cluster.py:160``,
    ``run_prototype.py:529/613``), while ``reward_family.py``'s own docstring points at
    ``eureka_loop.yaml`` — so editing the authoritative-LOOKING file would change nothing that runs.
    Neither YAML is in freeze's ``_BOUND_CONFIGS``, so drift also leaves ``--check`` green.

    ⚠ NOT closed by this test, and NOT mine to decide: the numeric ranges appear NOWHERE in the frozen
    pre-registration (``config/preregistration.yaml`` has no ``reward_family``; PREREGISTRATION.md R28
    registers the six primitives and the fixed ``cvar_alpha=0.05``/``window=20`` in prose, but not the
    weight box). Registering them is a design decision for Tamer/Ramin; this test only locks the three
    live copies to each other.
