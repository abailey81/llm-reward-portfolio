build_prompt_set fills {ENV_INTERFACE}, and that run_loop actually SENDS the injected prompts

    H2's effect is the MARGINAL value of tail-specificity. That reading only holds if the text every

    arm's block would be redundant rather than informative, and a null would be uninterpretable.
    The claim was verified once by hand (construct-validity audit) but never pinned, so a later
    prompt edit could silently dissolve the identification (deep review loop 81).

    Tail-neutral does NOT mean risk-neutral: the shared text deliberately says "optimise
    RISK-ADJUSTED performance" and names an online Sharpe, which is exactly why the SCALAR arm is the
