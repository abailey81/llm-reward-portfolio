"""The registered analysis-output key set must be MACHINE-DEFINED, not remembered.

Why this exists
---------------
Four registered outputs — ``benchmark_floor`` (the DeMiguel 1/N floor, already wired into the PDF),
``attribution``, ``h2_rf_robustness``, ``regime_stratified`` — would have been silently absent from
the final analysis because one file, ``campaign_summary.json``, does not exist for RUN 4. The only
signal was a print that named ONE of the four, and the analysis exited 0 regardless.

CLAUDE.md's scope clause pins the enumeration to "the 35 ``out[...]`` keys of
scripts/analyze_campaign.py". Measured: 32 subscript assignments and 7 keys in the annotated
``out: dict[str, Any] = {...}`` initialiser — 39 in the union, and 35 matches none of the three
numbers. A remembered count is exactly how a quantity escapes an enumeration that is supposed to be
exhaustive, so the registry is pinned to the source here instead.

The test derives the key set from the AST by BOTH routes. Counting only subscript assignments is
the wrong-denominator error in its purest form: it would silently shrink the registry by seven.
