"""The console-codepage lock — written because a codepage KILLED the post-campaign runsheet.

On 2026-07-27 `scripts/bank_gate.py` died with `UnicodeEncodeError` while **printing a log tail**.
It reads subprocess output with `errors="replace"`, which injects U+FFFD, and this box's console is
cp1251, which cannot encode it. The analysis that runs AFTER a 23-day campaign was killed by a
console codepage — the most expensive possible moment in the project to lose.

Note cp1251 *does* map the em-dash, which is why this hid for so long: only the rarer glyphs
(`★ → ≥ ⚠`) and U+FFFD bite. The exposure was measured across the launch-critical scripts and 9 were
unguarded, including `freeze.py` (GO step 1), `run_campaign_cluster.py` (the launcher) and
`sentinel.py` (which runs for the whole campaign).

These tests make that unrepeatable: one behavioural check that the helper cannot itself fail, and one
structural lock over the scripts where a crash is most expensive.
