"""D14 — a PARTIAL core-arm failure must stop the pass BEFORE the CRN-paired H2 array.

Regression for `CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_RECORD.md` §25 and `docs/DEFERRED_FIXES_RUN4.md` item 4.

**The asymmetry that made this dangerous.** `_arm_core`'s `except` is deliberate — one unit must
not sink the ladder. When EVERY arm crashes the line exits, the supervisor logs a non-zero rc and
the watchdog revives it; six lines did exactly that on launch night and all recovered. When only
SOME arms crash, the survivors carry the process onward: nothing exits, nothing revives, and the
dead arms are stranded for the life of the run. `nemotron-3-super` ran 8 h 29 m with 3 of its 5
arms that way. **The louder failure was the safe one.**

**And the damage is scientific, not merely wasted compute.** The statement immediately after the
arm drain builds the H2 pair test from `winners`, as ONE `interleave=True` CRN-paired array. A
crashed arm has no winner, so it would be SILENTLY ABSENT — every seed in that array paired against
a comparator set that is not the registered one. `test_*_pair_test_is_not_submitted_*` is the test
that pins this, and it is the reason the fix stops the pass rather than merely logging.

**The fix must be NARROW, and `test_a_designed_no_winner_does_not_stop_the_line` is the control.**
A `no_winner`, an R115 ineligibility, or a canary-gated arm is a legitimate RESULT of the
experiment, not a fault. Stopping on those would turn an ordinary scientific outcome into an
operational alarm and would loop the line forever. Only an arm that RAISED (carrying an `error`
key) stops anything.
