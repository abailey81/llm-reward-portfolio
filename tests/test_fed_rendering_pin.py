"""R114 drift guard: the REGISTERED fed-block precision must equal what the renderer emits.

R114 registered the rendered precision of the fed block as a design parameter — because the reward
designer never sees a float, it sees a STRING, so quantization is part of the stimulus. The values
live in ``config/preregistration.yaml: fed_rendering`` and are implemented in
``src/feedback/schema.py``.

⚠ WHY THIS TEST EXISTS. Nothing compared the two. The freeze binds ``schema.py`` into the canonical
hash (#97), which makes a POST-freeze edit detectable — but PRE-freeze the registered number and the
emitted number could differ silently, and the freeze would then have sealed a registration that
misdescribes the instrument. Every comparably load-bearing value (SESOI, the equivalence margin, the
m=6 family, lambda_cvar, tf32) has a prose<->yaml assertion in ``freeze.py``; ``fed_rendering`` had
none, and neither did the suite. This is the same shape as the R110 JZS-prior gap that was repaired
the day before, and as R84's "a registered NAME requires a registered VALUE".

Deliberately a TEST rather than a freeze check: importing ``schema.py`` into the gate would drag the
feedback stack into a step that must stay import-light — the same reasoning R110 recorded for the
JZS pin.
