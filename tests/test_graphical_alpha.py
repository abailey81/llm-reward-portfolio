"""The RATIFIED primary decision rule: graphical alpha-propagation (Bretz et al. 2009).

These tests exist because the 2026-07-26 deep review found the rule REGISTERED AND RATIFIED (R108:
`primary_rule: bonferroni_weighted_graph`, R31 superseded) but with **no implementation anywhere** —
the analysis still computed only the superseded Bonferroni-over-4 mirror, so the confirmatory
inference could not be produced as registered (write-time registry row 36).

They are written to FAIL if the rule is removed, hardcoded, or drifts from the registered graph.
