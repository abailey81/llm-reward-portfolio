"""D15 — every launcher of a supervised line must carry the substrate host fence.

Regression for `CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_RECORD.md` §28 and `docs/DEFERRED_FIXES_RUN4.md` item 5.

**The rule these tests encode:** AN AUTOMATIC RESTARTER IS A SECOND LAUNCHER, AND MUST TAKE EVERY
PARAMETER THE THING THAT STARTED THE LINE TOOK. `mode_d_watchdog.ps1` already carried that warning
in its own header — for `OutDir` and `RemoteRoot`, the two parameters D4 had already caught it on —
and then omitted the third.

**What the omission costs.** The host fence (`node-d00b-024`, record §28) exists because a single
heterogeneous host put four archived records on an Intel Xeon Gold 6140 while every sibling ran on
a 6240. That is a CRN-pairing hazard inside a comparison unit, i.e. a validity defect, not an
ops annoyance. A revived line that silently reverts to the default fence re-opens it.

**⚠ AND `mode_d_launch.ps1` HAD THE SAME HOLE, WHICH THE REGISTER ONLY SUSPECTED.** Verified
2026-08-01 (RUN 10): the primary launcher passed NO `-ExcludeHosts` at all, so the live fence
existed only because the running processes were started with it BY HAND. A clean relaunch from
that script would have dropped it for ALL TWELVE LINES AT ONCE — strictly worse than the revival
case D15 describes.

**Why the sources are comment-stripped:** these files deliberately quote the flags they are about
in their headers, so matching raw text would let a mere COMMENT satisfy the test. A test that a
comment can satisfy is not a test.
