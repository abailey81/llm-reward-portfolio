"""D20 — the driver lock must test pid IDENTITY, not pid EXISTENCE.

Regression for `CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_RECORD.md` §59 and §100, and `docs/DEFERRED_FIXES_RUN4.md`
item 13. **This defect stranded a live line twice:**

  2026-07-31  `h3`   — Windows recycled a dead driver's pid onto `OpenConsole.exe`
  2026-08-01  `leg4` — pid 34216 recycled onto `backgroundTaskHost.exe`, stranding a line that
                       was ALREADY AT C4 for ~14 h. Every relaunch died 12 s in. Every guard green.

`psutil.pid_exists(pid)` answers a weaker question than the lock needs. The identity test is the
owner's process CREATE-TIME, recorded beside the pid: a recycled pid necessarily carries a later
create-time than the one written.

**The asymmetry is the design, and it is tested explicitly.** Breaking a LIVE owner's lock permits
two drivers on one batch — double requeue rounds and corrupted retry accounting, unrecoverable.
Failing to break a dead owner's lock stalls a line — recoverable, and the monitoring cycle now
auto-reaps it. So every ambiguity must resolve to "owned", and `test_ambiguity_resolves_to_owned`
is the test that pins that direction.
