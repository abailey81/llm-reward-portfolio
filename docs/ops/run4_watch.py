"""RUN 4 live guards — the invariants ~2,870 unit tests structurally cannot check.

Every collision that has hurt this campaign (D1 the reject-marker collision, D5 the C3 gate
collision, and the 2026-07-19 `pending_specs` case) is ONE shape: a resource shared by twelve
concurrent lines, keyed by an identifier unique only WITHIN one line. Every test exercises a
single line, so no test can see it. The only reliable detector is a live invariant — this file.

Schemas here were read off the real RUN 1 / RUN 3 archives, not from memory:
  <root>/<sub_root>/<arm>/<candidate_id>/record.json   generation, prompt, metrics{}
  <root>/<sub_root>/<arm>/llm_calls.jsonl              stop_reason, usage, request_pins
  <root>/<sub_root>/_rejects/<run_id>.json             permanent reject markers
  <root>/batches/<base>/<base>.permanent.jsonl         ledgered permanent abandonments
  <root>/spend_ledger_<tag>.jsonl                      cost rows (+ stop_reason from 18dead8)
  <root>/driver_<line>.log                             per-line driver output
