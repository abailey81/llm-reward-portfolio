# ⭐ REMOTE CONTROL — send instructions to the live session from your phone

**How it works.** Edit this file on GitHub (pencil icon → commit), from a phone browser or the GitHub
app. The live session polls this branch, sees the change, reads your instruction, and acts on it —
then writes what it did under **LOG** at the bottom and pushes.

**Latency** is one poll interval (currently 5 minutes), not instant.

**Nothing else is needed** — no remote desktop, no extra software, no VPN.

## ▶ INSTRUCTIONS — write below this line

<!-- Write plain English. Anything you'd type into the session works. Examples:
     "status please"
     "what is the core count now"
     "stop the campaign"
     "restart the qwen3.5-9b leg"
     "raise the poll interval, you are hammering the login node"
     Leave it blank when you have nothing to say. -->

```
Make sure absolutely everything is strictly flawless, also to the run4_status dont forget to add teh cores active, and current eta's as well. Ultrathink

## ⚠ LIMITS — what this can and cannot do

| | |
|---|---|
| works while | the Claude Code session on the laptop is alive and polling |
| does NOT work if | the laptop sleeps, loses network, or the session is closed |
| the campaign itself | **keeps running regardless** — it is independent processes (supervisors + watchdog + sentinel), not part of the session |
| emergencies | the stop lever is a FILE: `outputs\campaign_cluster_run4\STOP_CAMPAIGN`. Asking here is the easy route; it stops RESTARTS, not an already-running driver |

**If the session dies**, the campaign continues untouched. A fresh session resumes from
`docs/HANDOFF.md` §1 + `docs/CAMPAIGN_EXECUTION_RECORD.md` §22–§23, which are kept current.
