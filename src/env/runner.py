"""Environment runner — the ``env_builder`` keystone the discovery loop injects.

The reward-discovery loop (``src/llm/loop.py``) and the search arms
(``src/search/*``) are written against an injected ``env_builder(reward_fn) -> env``
where ``env`` exposes::

    train_env()            -> a PortfolioEnv on the TRAIN window (for SAC training)
    val_returns(policy)    -> realized VALIDATION portfolio returns (for selection)
    train_returns(policy)  -> realized TRAINING portfolio returns (for measurement)
    test_returns(policy)   -> realized held-out TEST returns (FINAL inference ONLY; sealed)

Nothing in the repo implemented that contract (it was only faked in tests); this
module provides it (MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN P3).

Design (literature-anchored)
----------------------------
- **One anonymised Panel, two integer windows.** The train/val windows are
  half-open ``[start, end)`` slices into a *single* survivorship-free, point-in-time
  Panel (Brown et al. 1992 — survivorship-free; Cont 2001 — the real fat tails are
  the point). The validation observations' lookback history is therefore drawn from
  the (strictly past) training-period rows — no look-ahead (audit C-5; the env's
  ``_obs`` only ever reads ``returns[t-lookback:t]``).
- **Two splits, two roles (audit B-2/B-3).** ``train_returns`` feeds the
  *measurement* of the realized-return distribution (the contribution channel);
  ``val_returns`` feeds the *held-out fitness* (selection). They are deliberately on
  different splits so the loop cannot tune-then-select on the same data.
- **Deterministic walk-forward rollout** (Sood 2023 backtest protocol): the policy
  is rolled out greedily (``deterministic=True``) over the window, and the realized
  per-step portfolio return (net of turnover cost) is collected from
  ``info["port_ret"]``.

The rollout is policy-agnostic: it calls ``policy.predict(obs, deterministic=True)``,
so it works with a raw Stable-Baselines3 model OR the obs-normalising
``NormalizedPolicy`` returned by ``src.agents.trainer`` (which carries train-only
observation statistics, deep-research §2).

        Trading-day embargo enforced at *both* split boundaries (config/inference.yaml
        ``embargo_trading_days`` == config/data.yaml ``embargo_days`` == 21). The default

        Optional per-unit-turnover cost OVERRIDE in bps (the ``costs.grid_bps`` robustness

    lookback : int, default 0
        The FEATURE lookback (``state.lookback_days``), enforced as part of the inter-split
        purge: the guard below requires ``max(embargo, lookback)`` sessions between splits,
        because an embargo shorter than the lookback still lets the downstream window's first
