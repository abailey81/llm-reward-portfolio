"""Portfolio environment — the risk-sensitive RL MDP with an injected reward.

This module implements the trading MDP described in FINAL_PLAN Part B.2 / F.1.
The defining feature (audit A-4) is that the reward is **not** hardcoded: a
callable conforming to the reward contract (`src/reward/contract.py`) is injected
at construction and invoked every `step`. This lets the LLM-designed reward arms,
the hand-designed baseline rewards, and the search baselines all drive the *same*
fixed SB3 SAC agent through an identical environment.

Algorithm sketch (FINAL_PLAN F.1, Part B.2):
  - Action a_t is a raw vector in R^{N+1} (N risky assets + cash). It is projected
    to the long-only simplex Delta^N by a *frozen* projection chosen in Phase 1
    (softmax OR L1-normalization-of-clipped; selected via cfg, audit C-8).
  - Reward-timing (audit C-5): the asset-return vector r_t = panel.returns[t] is
    realized *after* the action is taken. gross = w[:N] @ r_t.
  - Transaction cost = c * turnover with half-L1-DRIFTED turnover (docs/environment_spec_v1.md):
    turnover = 0.5 * ||w - w_held||_1 where w_held is the book the agent ACTUALLY carries
    into step t — the previous target drifted by the return that target earned, r_{t-1}
    (cash grows at 1 + cash_daily_rate); c from the cost grid (headline 10 bps).
    info["turnover"] is emitted for logging sidecars.
  - Portfolio return port_ret = gross - cost; log-wealth += log1p(port_ret).
  - reward_fn(w, r_t, w_prev, port_ret, info) -> (total, components, reward_state).
    The agent optimizes `total`; `components` are logged; `reward_state` is
    round-tripped via `info` to support stateful rewards (audit B-4).
  - Observations are built from data with index <= t only — no look-ahead. Lagged
    VIX / realized vol / lookback returns / cash row / previous weights.

Audit refs: A-4 (reward slot), B-4 (stateful reward via info), C-5 (reward timing),
C-8 (frozen simplex projection, lagged VIX in obs).

def project_simplex(action: np.ndarray, kind: str = "softmax") -> np.ndarray:
    """Project a raw action vector onto the long-only simplex.

    Parameters
    ----------
    action : np.ndarray, shape (N+1,)
        Raw action over the ``N`` risky assets plus cash.
    kind : str
        Frozen projection (audit C-8). ``"softmax"`` maps any real vector to the
        interior of the simplex; ``"l1_normalize_of_clipped"`` clips at zero and
        normalises by the L1 norm (falls back to uniform when all-zero).

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray, shape (N+1,)
        Non-negative weights summing to 1.

    Limitations
    -----------
    The frozen ``"softmax"`` projection maps onto the OPEN interior of the simplex:
    every weight (including the cash sleeve) is strictly positive, so it can NEVER
    reach an EXACT corner — in particular it cannot output a true 100%-cash allocation
    (``w_cash == 1`` with every risky weight exactly 0). It can only approach it
    asymptotically as the cash logit dominates (bounded further by ``action.bound``,
    which caps the pre-softmax logit magnitude). This structurally DAMPS the full
    "flee to cash" response that a tail-risk-averse agent most wants in a crisis. The
    alternative ``"l1_normalize_of_clipped"`` projection (clip-at-zero then L1-normalise)
    CAN hit exact zero weights / the cash corner, but ``"softmax"`` is the FROZEN
    Phase-1 choice (audit C-8) and is NOT changed here. This is a ceiling that applies
    EQUALLY to every feedback arm (scalar and tail-fed alike), so it is a shared
    limitation of the action parameterisation, not a confound for the H2 contrast.
    Disclosed for the write-up's limitations section; behaviour is unchanged.

        A callable conforming to the reward contract, invoked once per ``step``.
    start, end : int | None
        Half-open trading window ``[start, end)`` into the panel. ``start``

        ``self.cost = cost_bps * 1e-4`` replaces it, so the cost-sweep harness

        level without retraining. Everything else (timing, turnover, reward) is
        identical, so a swept env differs from the headline env ONLY in ``self.cost``.

        ⚠ WHAT THE REWARD'S ``info`` ACTUALLY CONTAINS (corrected 2026-07-27, deep review #120).
        This said the reward's ``info`` "also carries the realized ``turnover``". It does NOT.
        ``reward_info`` is shallow-copied from ``info`` BEFORE :func:`safe_call`, at which point the
        only keys are ``weights`` / ``prev_weights`` / ``reward_state``; ``turnover``, ``cost``,
        ``gross``, ``port_ret``, ``components`` and ``log_wealth`` are attached to the RETURNED
        ``info`` AFTERWARDS, for the CALLER (``src/env/runner.py`` reads ``gross``/``turnover`` —
        the correct consumer). No reward in the repo depends on them and the authoring prompt
        advertises only ``info["reward_state"]``, so nothing is broken — but the distinction is
        load-bearing for anyone writing a new reward, because :func:`safe_call` SWALLOWS the
        resulting ``KeyError`` and substitutes ``SAFE_DEFAULT``: a reward reaching for
        ``info["turnover"]`` would score a constant 0.0 every step and read as a bad reward DESIGN
        rather than a broken one. A reward that wants turnover must compute it, as the frozen canon's
        ``return_minus_turnover`` does (``0.5*sum|w - prev_weights|``) — which is the
        target-to-target change, deliberately NOT the env's charged basis ``0.5*sum|w - w_held|``
        (see the #92 note in the body); a hand reward defines its own objective.

        Returns
        -------
        tuple
            ``(obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info)``. The MDP has no absorbing
            terminal state — the episode ends ONLY because the fixed ``[start, end)``
            walk-forward window runs out of timesteps, which is a Gymnasium
            *truncation*, not a *termination*. So ``terminated`` is always False and
            ``truncated`` is True once ``t`` reaches ``end`` (final-audit fix: the

            terminated makes SB3 SAC's ``(1 - dones)`` factor zero the value bootstrap

        over each configured window on the same strictly-past returns, the VIX value
        knowable at ``t``, a constant cash-row marker, and the previous weights.

        The *returns* window invariant is strict: it never reads any return row with
        index ``>= t`` (``returns[t]`` is the *future* realisation consumed only in
        :meth:`step`). The VIX index is convention-dependent and is corrected here to
        match the implementation (final-audit fix to a previously false "never index
        ``>= t``" claim): on the contemporaneous (synthetic) convention the env lags to
        ``vix[t-1]``; on a prelagged gold panel (``vix_prelagged=True``) row ``t`` already
        holds the ``t-1`` close, so the env reads ``vix[t]`` (index ``== t``) — still a
        ``t-1`` close, hence no look-ahead, but it IS a panel row at index ``t``.
