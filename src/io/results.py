"""Per-run results schema and the canonical results loader (FINAL_PLAN F.13, audit C-1).

This module defines the per-run record schema and provides the ONLY interface that
analysis code may use to read results (audit C-1: never parse run files ad hoc).
Every campaign run writes exactly one record under ``<root>/<run_id>/record.json``;
every table, figure and inference step reads it back through :func:`load_run` /
:func:`load_all`. Centralising IO here guarantees the provenance fields (hashes,
seeds, environment fingerprint) are always present and that the loader fails loudly
when a required field is missing.

If a record carries a ``reward_source`` string, it is archived alongside the record
as ``reward.py`` so results *replay from the archive* and are never regenerated
(audit C-2): the LLM that produced the reward is non-deterministic. Likewise a
``prompt`` is archived as ``prompt.txt`` (Rank 14) so the prompt that produced the
reward is never lost (CLAUDE.md §6: "archive every prompt").

The self-contained ``record.json`` is the authoritative copy (it carries the embedded
``reward_source``/``prompt`` so analysis never depends on a separate file). The
``reward.py``/``prompt.txt`` sidecars are the on-disk archive: :func:`load_run` VERIFIES
each sidecar byte-for-byte against the embedded copy and fails loudly on any mismatch, so
the "replay from the archive" guarantee is enforced — a tampered sidecar cannot pass
silently — rather than merely asserted (symmetric with the env.json integrity check).

Audit refs: C-1 (analysis reads only through this module), C-2 (replay from archive).

#: Additive, OPTIONAL provenance fields a record MAY carry (Rank 2/3). They are
#: documented here so writers/readers share one vocabulary, but they are deliberately
#: NOT in :data:`REQUIRED_FIELDS`: adding them as required would break every existing
#: writer (the loop, the search arms, ``run_prototype``) and the loader round-trip
#: tests. The headline campaign (``scripts/run_campaign.py``) writes the frozen-winner
#: test record with these set; the realized per-step test-return vector and per-period
#: P&L additionally ride inside ``metrics`` (where ``analyze_results`` already reads
#: ``metrics['val_returns']``) so Rank 3's PBO can consume them back-compatibly.
#:
#:  - ``frozen``            : ``True`` on a sealed frozen-winner record.
#:  - ``test_returns``      : realized per-step held-out (2020-2026) NET return vector.
#:  - ``per_period_pnl``    : per-period P&L vector aligned to ``test_returns``.
#:  - ``reward_source``     : the winner's reward source (already archived as reward.py).
#:  - ``prompt``            : (Rank 14) the rendered LLM user prompt that produced the candidate.
#:                           ``write_run`` dumps it to a ``prompt.txt`` sidecar (next to reward.py)
#:                           and ``load_run`` verifies it byte-for-byte against the embedded copy, so
#:                           results *replay from the archive* (CLAUDE.md §6: "archive every prompt";
#:                           audit C-2 — a tampered sidecar raises ``ValueError``). The LLM arms
#:                           (``src/llm/loop.py`` + the parallel/run_prototype writers) set it;
#:                           the search arms and sealed-test records omit it (no sidecar written).
#:
#: Rank 15 (cost-sweep) additively persists the per-step GROSS and TURNOVER decomposition of
#: the frozen-winner test path inside ``metrics`` (``metrics['test_gross']`` +
#: ``metrics['test_turnover']``, mirroring how ``metrics['test_returns']`` rides). These let
#: ``scripts/cost_sweep.py`` ANALYTICALLY re-price the FROZEN winner at every ``costs.grid_bps``
#: level without retraining (``net_c = gross - c*1e-4 * turnover``), since the realized gross
#: and turnover do not depend on the cost level (audit C-5: the cost is charged AFTER the
#: action). They are OPTIONAL (a record lacking them just triggers the re-roll fallback), so
#: the schema stays back-compatible with every existing writer.
#: Rank 3 (PBO/CSCV) additionally relies on a per-CANDIDATE per-period VALIDATION return
#: vector riding inside ``metrics['val_returns']``. ALL SIX arms now write it during
#: search: the LLM arms via ``src/llm/loop.py``, the search arms via
#: ``scripts/run_prototype.py`` (sequential) and ``src/orchestration/parallel.py``
#: (parallel). ``scripts/analyze_campaign.py`` stacks those vectors per arm into the
#: CSCV performance matrix. It is OPTIONAL (a record that lacks it is skipped with a
#: logged warning) so the schema stays back-compatible with every existing writer.
#:
#: 2026-07-26 (M1/M1b/M2/M3) — report-only, determinism-safe RUN DIAGNOSTICS additionally ride inside
#: ``metrics`` on the frozen-winner TEST record (same pattern as ``test_gross``; no schema change), so the
#: replay-only campaign records the data the equity/drawdown/exposure/allocation/learning-curve figures
#: need (a frozen run can only plot what it logged):
#:   - ``metrics['test_exposure']``   : per-step Herfindahl / effective-N / max / top-5 concentration (M1)
#:   - ``metrics['test_alloc']``      : top-K-by-mean monthly allocation snapshots for the heatmap (M1b)
#:   - ``metrics['test_components']`` : per-component mean of the reward decomposition over the test path (M3)
#:   - ``metrics['train_curve']``     : this seed's downsampled training curve (critic/actor loss + return, M2)
#: All are OPTIONAL + best-effort (a capture miss never crashes an irreplaceable sealed seed).
