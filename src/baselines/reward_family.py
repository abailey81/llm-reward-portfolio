"""H4 parametric reward family — the BO-over-template search space (FINAL_PLAN B.5 / ADR-010).

Both H4 search arms draw from this FIXED six-term linear reward family rather than free-form
code: the Bayesian-optimization arm (H4b) GP-EI-tunes its six weights, and the random-search
control (H4a, ``src/search/random_search.py``) draws the same six weights from a coarse grid over
the same ranges at the same fixed discrete dims. Comparing the LLM's free-form code against the
best member of this family isolates "reward-form richness" from "search procedure"
(PREREGISTRATION §4a). The family's vertices recover the hand-designed canon (return / turnover /
drawdown / CVaR / volatility), so H4b is a like-for-like comparison of free-form LLM code against
the best member of this PARAMETRIC family. It is NOT a like-for-like SEARCH-SPACE comparison: the
LLM authors strictly richer free-form code, so a positive H4 reflects open-ended-language plus
procedure, not procedure alone (see docs/DEEP_H4.md §1). H4a (random search over the SAME family)
is the procedure-only control at comparable expressive power.

The archived pre-merge version (``archive/pre_merge_repo_B/src_flat/reward_family.py``) used the
OLD ``RewardContext`` contract and is NOT compatible with the live engine. This is the
LIVE-contract implementation (authored per the P5 API audit — the function existed only as an
injected parameter name in ``src/agents/evaluator.py``):

    reward(weights, returns, prev_weights, port_ret, info) -> (total, components, reward_state)

The six weights are searched over the frozen ranges in ``config/eureka_loop.yaml: reward_family``.
The two discrete dims (``cvar_alpha``, ``window``) are FIXED for the continuous-box BO
(``bayes_opt_over_template`` handles continuous boxes only); the prototype fixes ``alpha=0.05``,
``window=20`` and searches the six weights.

    The BO arm (H4b) searches over the parametric family and only ever holds an in-memory
    closure (:func:`params_to_reward`). For the FROZEN winner to round-trip through the sealed
    TEST leg on the IDENTICAL path as the LLM / random-search arms, its archived
    ``reward_source`` must be a runnable ``def reward(...)`` — NOT a ``# coeffs=[...]`` comment
    stub (which ``run_campaign._reinstantiate_frozen_winner`` -> ``validate_once`` cannot
    rehydrate, recording the arm ``winner_not_testable``).

    This emits the SAME six-term family computation as :func:`params_to_reward`, with the six
    weights, the (fixed) CVaR level ``cvar_alpha`` and the rolling ``window`` substituted in as
    literals. The emitted source:

      - obeys the canonical contract ``reward(weights, returns, prev_weights, port_ret, info)
        -> (total, components, reward_state)`` (``validate_signature`` accepts it);
      - passes ``ast_gate`` (numpy-only attributes, no banned IO/FFI, no dunders, no forbidden
        calls), so ``validate_once`` admits it;
      - threads the SAME ``reward_state`` shape ``(hist, peak, cum)`` and the same numpy ops as
        the closure, so it reproduces ``params_to_reward(coeffs, cvar_alpha, window)`` output
        for output on any call sequence (to floating-point identity — the coefficients are
        emitted via ``repr`` for an exact round-trip).
