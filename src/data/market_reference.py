"""Portfolio-level REFERENCE series for the evaluation / reporting layer (block B11/B13).

These series live ENTIRELY in inference/reporting — they never enter the frozen, anonymised env
observation or a reward (so H2's contribution surface is untouched; data-enrichment research
2026-06-20). All three are already pulled + frozen on disk by ``data_pipeline``:

* **risk-free rate** — FRED ``DGS3MO`` (3-month T-bill secondary-market yield) from
  ``data/raw/fred_macro.csv``, converted to a per-session decimal. Replaces the ``rf = 0`` hardwire
  in the headline Sharpe/Sortino/Deflated-Sharpe (the "rf cancels in pairwise comparison" defence is
  false for differing-volatility benchmark comparisons). The per-session rate is the GEOMETRIC
  ``(1 + DGS3MO/100)**(1/252) - 1`` (annualised yield in percent -> daily decimal); DGS3MO is preferred
  over the Fama-French daily RF, which is piecewise-constant within each month (Dimitrov & Govindaraj,
  JOIM 2021). Any change to the rf CONVENTION in the headline is pre-registration-relevant (R20).
* **market proxy** — ``market_ew`` (equal-weight return of the FULL survivorship-free PIT universe)
  from ``data/gold/market_proxy_<suffix>.parquet``. A REAL broad-market line for alpha / beta /
  information-ratio reporting — distinct from the 30-asset 1/N strategy (the anonymised panel has no
  index column, so this EW-universe series is the EQUAL-WEIGHT market stand-in).
* **S&P 500 total return** — ``.SPXTR`` from ``data/raw/rf_spxtr.csv`` (+ the ``_x26`` extension),
  pulled from Refinitiv and frozen with provenance on 2026-07-01. **CAP-WEIGHTED**, and therefore the
  benchmark a reader actually means by "the market"; the equal-weight proxy above is a different
  animal (it tilts small and rebalances). Added 2026-07-30 — see :func:`load_spx_total_return`.

  ⚠ **CORRECTION, 2026-07-30.** This docstring previously read *"a cap-weighted SPX-TR remains a
  documented limitation"*. **That was FALSE**: the ``.SPXTR`` series had been pulled, frozen and
  provenance-stamped on 2026-07-01 and was sitting in ``data/raw/`` unloaded — ``grep rf_spxtr src
  scripts`` returned nothing. We documented a limitation we did not have. Found only because Tamer
  asked "don't we have S&P 500?", not by any check of ours; the lesson is filed with the process
  errors — **a "documented limitation" must be re-verified against the disk before it is written, or
  it becomes a false statement that survives precisely because it sounds humble.**
* **Fama-French factors** — ``Mkt-RF, SMB, HML`` from ``data/raw/french_F-F_Research_Data_Factors_daily.csv``
  (the Momentum file ``french_F-F_Momentum_Factor_daily.csv`` is on disk but NOT loaded here; add it to
  ``load_ff_factors`` if a 4-factor attribution is wanted), for OUT-OF-SAMPLE attribution in the analysis chapter.

Every loader ALIGNS to the panel's own session axis (so a value is knowable at each trading date),
forward-fills the rare publication gaps (never reading the future), and degrades gracefully to a
zero/empty series with ``available=False`` when a file is absent (a synthetic-only install), so no
caller crashes. Any change to the RF/benchmark CONVENTION is pre-registration-relevant (ADR-038, R20).
