"""Load the frozen REAL gold panel (Refinitiv) into the engine's :class:`Panel`.

The gold panel in ``data/gold/`` is the survivorship-free, point-in-time research data built by
``data_pipeline/`` (ADR-019…022): ``returns_panel_univ5.parquet`` (5,406 sessions × 963 RICs,
2005–2026H1; ADR-044/051 — ``univ3``, 5,283 × 953 to 2025, is the frozen pre-Split-C reference),
``cash_features_univ5.parquet`` (``vol20``, ``vol20_over_vol60``, ``vix`` = FRED VIXCLS —
CBOE ``.VIX`` is not licensed), and ``top30_selection_univ5.parquet`` (the point-in-time top-30 RICs at
each window start). This module slices a single window's top-30 into a finite, **anonymised** ``Panel``
the environment can train on.

Two invariants are enforced here so the contamination defence (N3, FINAL_PLAN B.8) and the env's
finiteness contract hold:

1. **Anonymisation.** The ``Panel`` carries only integer ``asset_ids`` (``0..N-1``) — **no RICs, no
   tickers, no dates ever reach a reward**. The RIC↔id mapping is returned *separately* (opt-in) for
   provenance/analysis only and must never be passed into a reward or the LLM.

2. **Finiteness via an explicit delisting policy.** A survivorship-free top-30 contains names that die
   mid-window (e.g. Wachovia ``WB.N^A09`` delists 2009; Dell ``DELL.OQ^J13`` goes private 2013), so the
   raw slice has NaNs after delisting. The env *rejects* non-finite rows (``environment_spec_v1``), so a
   policy is required. The default, ``on_missing="liquidate_to_cash"``, sets post-event / missing returns
   to ``0.0`` (proceeds held flat ≈ cash) — the standard survivorship-correct treatment that preserves
   the dead names rather than dropping them (dropping would silently re-introduce survivorship bias).

   ✔ **RATIFIED (PREREGISTRATION.md R44/R73; ``config/preregistration.yaml`` resolves ADR-024).** The
   intra-window delisting mechanic is the frozen-design headline choice: ``liquidate_to_cash`` (d=0 zero-fill,
   preserving the delisting-day return) is the headline treatment, with the recovery band {0,−30,−55,−100}
   carried as a report-only post-hoc sensitivity that is disjoint from training.

    # rescale the fractional convention up by 100 so the WHOLE system speaks one unit: the regime
    # thresholds (config/regimes.yaml calm<15 / stress>25), the synthetic panel (~10-50), and the
    # trainer's documented obs range (~10-80). Without this the VIX-threshold rule labelled EVERY gold
    # date calm (all vix < 15) and the independent-regime count COLLAPSED to 1 — the vix-units bug
    # (2026-06-19). The env obs is scale-agnostic (VecNormalize, ADR), so this only corrects regime
    # stratification; the frozen parquet is untouched (transform on read; magnitude-guarded so a points
    # gold is never double-scaled). NB (final-audit #19): POINTS is the canonical LIVE unit — the env
    # obs, the regime thresholds, and the synthetic panel all speak points; the pipeline's /vix_scale
    # FRACTION is its internal storage convention, deliberately reconciled here on read (NOT a silent
    # revert). The env feeds BOTH the obs (scale-agnostic under VecNormalize) and regime labelling from
    # this one array, so a single canonical unit is the correct design, not a conflation.

    Resolves ``val_start = max(materialized_boundary, first_post_train + max(embargo_days, lookback))``:

    1. **Materialized embargo boundary (a FLOOR).** ``development.validation_post_embargo[0]`` from
       ``data/gold/splits_<suffix>.parquet`` is read as the embargo floor — honoured only when it sits
       AFTER the train end (a real embargo). **SPLIT-C NOTE (ADR-044):** the frozen tables still record
       the PRE-Split-C dev boundary (2015-02-03), which predates the Split-C train_end (2016-12-31) and
       is therefore inert; the fallback purge below governs. **R18 NOTE:** with a feature ``lookback``
       (production = 60) the lookback purge DOMINATES the +21 embargo floor (~2017-02-02), so the
       EXECUTED val starts 2017-03-30 (train_end + 60 sessions) — the materialized parquet records only
       the EMBARGO, while execution applies the larger feature-lookback purge. (With ``lookback=0`` and
       a post-train boundary, the boundary is honoured exactly, e.g. in the legacy embargo-only unit tests.)
    2. **Fallback (no split table).** Purge ``max(embargo_days, lookback)`` TRADING sessions after
       ``train_end`` — used on a synthetic-only install. ``lookback=0`` reduces this to the embargo.

    ----------
    dates:

    train_end:
        Inclusive last TRAIN session (the boundary the embargo is measured from).
    phase, embargo_days, gold_dir:
        The split phase to read, the fallback embargo in trading days, and the gold dir.

    -------
