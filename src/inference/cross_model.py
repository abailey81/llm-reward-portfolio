"""Cross-model synthesis for the v2 replication legs — REPORT-ONLY (R80/R82, frozen spec).

The replication legs (ten under R95) share the market panel and the CRN seed set BY DESIGN (pairing), so they are NOT
independent replications: a naive binomial sign test (0.5^k) would overstate the evidence. The
registered synthesis therefore has two tiers:

* :func:`sign_count` — the replication count reported DESCRIPTIVELY, on the CVaR-leg (tail)
  distributional-vs-scalar contrast (the Sharpe leg is predicted-tie for every model, so its sign
  is noise by design), with the T0-floor leg-inclusion criterion: a leg whose winners fail the
  naive-benchmark floor in either contrasted arm is an authoring/search FAILURE — reported in the
  reliability table, never counted as a vote.
* :func:`permutation_test` — the inferential tier: for each shared CRN seed, flip the
  (distributional <-> scalar) assignment with p=1/2 SIMULTANEOUSLY across all included legs and
  recompute the sign statistic. Because the flip is per-seed and joint across legs, the
  shared-seed/shared-panel dependence lives INSIDE the null distribution instead of being
  falsely assumed away (10,000 reps, seeded).

Plus the registered instruments: :func:`pair_did` (the family-pair content-effect x capability
interaction on the COMMON floor-30 seed subset, seed-paired bootstrap), :func:`leg_family_bh`
(BH across the report-only leg family — delegates to the existing implementation),
:func:`generation_indexed_responsiveness` (does feedback-use strengthen across the loop's
generations? — reuses the SQ1 estimator), and :func:`capability_regression` (responsiveness vs a
capability anchor; primary = the pre-declared external composite, secondary = the M2 reading
score). Everything here is deterministic under its seed and DISJOINT from the m=6 confirmatory
machinery — nothing gates H1–H4.

✅ WIRED — and this paragraph is the correction of a stale warning (deep review #115, 2026-07-27).
:func:`pooled_bound` is registered as *the* cross-model bounded-effect statement (R86,
``config/preregistration.yaml: synthesis_exactness.pooled_bound``) and **R101 reframed the headline
around it**, so whether it has an executable route to a number is load-bearing. It does:
``scripts/analyze_campaign.py`` imports ``leg_aggregate.cross_model_synthesis`` and CALLS it
(``out["cross_model"] = cross_model_synthesis(root)``), which chains into this module's
:func:`sign_count` / :func:`permutation_test` / :func:`pooled_bound` via the import inside
``cross_model_synthesis``. The end-to-end test exists and also locks the anti-fabrication states:
``tests/test_leg_aggregate.py`` ("the production wiring (row 34)"), including
``test_no_leg_archives_is_MISSING_DATA_not_a_null_effect`` and
``test_a_missing_T0_floor_is_a_MISSING_INPUT_not_a_result``.

⚠ HISTORY, kept because the correction matters more than the claim: until 2026-07-27 this docstring
opened "NOT YET WIRED … no production caller … do not read this docstring as describing an executed
path". That was TRUE when written (2026-07-26, deep review loop 4) and was made FALSE the same day by
the wiring change, which did not update it. ``docs/V2_WRITE_TIME_REGISTRY.md`` row 34 WAS corrected
(it carries a "CLOSED BY ROUTE (a) — WIRED" box, left open rather than ticked because discharging an
obligation is Tamer's call) — so the fact was fixed in the register and never followed into the CODE,
the exact inverse of the #107 lesson. The stale text was actively harmful, not merely untidy: row
34's two closure routes are "wire it" or "WITHDRAW the registered claim", so a writer trusting this
docstring could have withdrawn a claim that is in fact executable, after the compute was spent. The
same paragraph also warned of a "latent per-period-vs-annualised floor-unit trap in ``leg_aggregate``
that only bites on wiring" — that trap was fixed in the same 2026-07-26 change (``per_seed_series``
delegates to the canonical ``bootstrap.sharpe_ratio``, removing the annualisation and ddof
discrepancies together).

The R16 precedent the old text invoked still stands as the reason to check: ``h2_conjunction`` was
"implemented and unit-tested but previously unwired, so the documented headline test never actually
ran". A unit-tested module is not a wired one — which is why the wiring above is asserted by an
end-to-end test rather than by this sentence.
