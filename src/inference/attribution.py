"""Factor-attribution of frozen-winner TEST returns — the difference-in-alpha Door-C secondary.

Why this module exists (the #1 un-planned reviewer hole)
--------------------------------------------------------
The headline H2 result is "distributional feedback beats scalar feedback" on the held-out test
leg. The sharpest un-planned attack on it (deep-research Part 7, red-team #6;
``00_planning/CAMPAIGN_DEEP_RESEARCH_FINDINGS_2026-06-21.md`` §5.10) is:

    "The agent's edge is just low-vol / betting-against-beta (BAB) beta — a known factor tilt,
     not the reward channel."

This module answers it the only defensible way: re-price each arm's *realized* test returns
against a ladder of published factor models (CAPM -> FF3 -> Carhart-4 -> FF5 -> FF6 -> +BAB ->
+QMJ) and report the **difference in intercept (alpha)** between the distributional and scalar
arms after removing the factor exposure. If the distributional arm's alpha *survives* the factor
controls (and BAB's beta is small while alpha persists), the edge is not "just BAB".

Door-C, not Door-A/B (the governing principle, deep-research Part 0)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a **measurement/inference** sharpening of the dependent variable (alpha instead of raw
Sharpe), computed entirely in the reporting layer. It NEVER touches the env, the reward, the
agent, or the treatment. It is a **separate, declared secondary family** with **disjoint result
keys** (``rung`` / ``factor`` / ``alpha_diff`` / ``seed``) that cannot be confused with the frozen
H2 family's ``arm_a`` / ``arm_b`` / ``metric`` / ``level`` keys — so
``scripts/analyze_campaign.assert_realized_family_matches_frozen`` stays green and the frozen m=6
is never mutated (deep-research Part 2, "amendment-free additions").

The econometrics (be exact; this is the load-bearing part)
----------------------------------------------------------
* **Model.** For one realized daily series ``r_t`` (the frozen winner's test path) and a factor
  matrix ``F_t`` (each column a long/short factor return, already in decimals), OLS

      ``(r_t - rf_t) = alpha + sum_k beta_k * F_{k,t} + eps_t``.

  ``Mkt-RF`` is itself an excess return so it enters raw; the *left-hand side* uses excess returns
  ``r - rf`` so ``alpha`` is the CAPM/multifactor intercept (Jensen's alpha). ``alpha`` is reported
  per period; annualised alpha = ``alpha * 252``.
* **Standard errors.** Daily portfolio residuals are serially correlated (volatility clustering,
  momentum/mean-reversion), so OLS SEs understate sampling error. We use **Newey & West (1987)**
  heteroskedasticity-and-autocorrelation-consistent (HAC) SEs with the **Bartlett kernel**
  ``w_l = 1 - l/(L+1)``. The truncation lag follows the **Newey & West (1994)** automatic-lag rule of
  thumb ``L = floor(4 * (T/100) ** (2/9))`` (cite Newey-West 1994 for the *lag rule*; Newey-West 1987
  for the *estimator* -- NOT Schwert 1989, whose ``12(T/100)^(1/4)`` is a different, ADF unit-root,
  rule). statsmodels' ``OLS.fit(cov_type="HAC")`` defaults ``maxlags`` to exactly this floored value
  and applies the Bartlett kernel; we pass the lag explicitly so it is logged and
  reproducible, and :func:`newey_west_hac_lag` is unit-tested against a hand-rolled Newey-West.
* **Difference-in-alpha (the headline of this module).** We do NOT pool the two arms into one
  series. Mirroring the frozen per-seed rliable inference (Agarwal et al. 2021;
  ``src.inference.bootstrap.paired_seed_difference_test``): for each arm we fit the factor model
  **per seed** (one frozen-winner test path per training seed) to obtain that seed's alpha, then run
  the **paired across-seed bootstrap** on the per-seed alpha differences ``alpha_a(seed) -
  alpha_b(seed)`` over the shared training seeds. This carries the across-seed (training-RNG)
  variance — the dominant uncertainty in a multi-seed RL evaluation — exactly as the headline does,
  rather than a single-path regression that would understate it.

What carries the inference, and what is merely descriptive (read before reporting a t-stat)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Per-seed factor alpha is a HAC-OLS POINT ESTIMATE; the decision is the across-seed paired
  bootstrap.** The per-``(arm, seed, rung)`` cell's HAC SE / t / p (Newey-West) describe one seed's
  single-path regression and are reported as **descriptive only** — they do NOT carry the inference,
  because they ignore the across-seed (training-RNG) variance. The actual verdict is the sign and
  two-sided p-value of the **paired across-seed bootstrap on the per-seed alpha differences**
  (``difference_in_alpha``); that, not the per-cell HAC t, is what decides whether the
  factor-adjusted edge is real.
* **The factor ladder is a MONOTONE ROBUSTNESS SEQUENCE with a pre-named headline rung, not a
  discovery family.** The rungs (CAPM -> FF3 -> Carhart-4 -> FF5 -> FF6 -> +BAB -> +QMJ) are nested
  controls of increasing strictness; the **pre-named headline rung is Carhart-4 (and +BAB once the
  AQR pull lands)** — the rung the BAB rebuttal lives on. Climbing the ladder is a *sensitivity*
  showing the alpha survives progressively stronger controls, so the **BH correction ACROSS rungs is
  a sensitivity adjustment, NOT a multiple-discovery family** (we are not fishing across rungs for a
  significant one; the headline rung is fixed in advance). This is a separate, declared secondary
  family from the frozen m=6 (disjoint keys) and never enters the headline conjunction.

Factor data — what is ON DISK vs what NEEDS A PULL (see ``docs/CAMPAIGN_attribution.md``)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **On disk** (``data/raw/``, decimals, daily, 2005-2026): ``Mkt-RF``, ``SMB``, ``HML``, ``RF``
  (``french_F-F_Research_Data_Factors_daily.csv``) and ``Mom`` / UMD
  (``french_F-F_Momentum_Factor_daily.csv``). -> CAPM, FF3, and Carhart-4 are fully constructable
  today.
* **Needs a Ken-French pull**: ``RMW``, ``CMA`` (FF5 profitability/investment) -> FF5, FF6.
* **Needs an AQR pull**: ``BAB`` (Frazzini-Pedersen 2014) and ``QMJ`` (Asness-Frazzini-Pedersen
  2019) -> +BAB, +QMJ rungs. QMJ in particular is NOT constructable from the panel (needs
  fundamentals).

Every rung whose factor columns are not all present is reported with ``status="skipped"`` and the
missing columns named — the harness DEGRADES GRACEFULLY and never fabricates an alpha it cannot
estimate (CLAUDE.md prime directive 4: no fabrication).

This module is import-light at module load (numpy + pandas only); statsmodels is imported lazily
inside the OLS path so the rest of the analysis stack does not pay for it.

    Shaped to the per-(arm, seed) frozen-winner TEST records ``scripts/run_campaign.py`` writes (each
    carrying ``metrics['test_returns']``). For each ``(arm_a, arm_b)`` contrast and each factor rung
    whose columns are ALL present, runs :func:`difference_in_alpha` (per-seed factor alphas -> paired
    across-seed bootstrap). The two-sided p-values are Benjamini-Hochberg corrected at ``q`` ACROSS
    the whole secondary family (every ``contrast x rung`` cell that ran), and the rejection set is
    returned alongside a per-cell ``direction_ok`` (distributional alpha higher). The result uses
    DISJOINT keys (``rung`` / ``factor`` / ``alpha_diff`` / ``seed``) so it can never be mistaken for
    the frozen H2 family (``arm_a`` / ``arm_b`` / ``metric`` / ``level``) — the
    ``assert_realized_family_matches_frozen`` guard stays green and the frozen m=6 is untouched.

    DEGRADES GRACEFULLY (status="skipped", never crashes) when:
      * ``factors`` is ``None`` or empty (no factor data on a synthetic-only install);
      * a contrast's arms have no test records (a missing comparator arm yields a credible null);
      * a rung's factor columns are not all present (e.g. FF5/BAB/QMJ before the data is pulled).

    Parameters
    ----------
    records : list of dict
        Per-(arm, seed) frozen-winner TEST records (carry ``metrics['test_returns']``).
    factors : dict[str, np.ndarray] | None
        ``{name: per-period factor series}`` aligned to the test window (e.g. from
        :func:`load_factor_panel`), or ``None`` when no factor data is available.
    contrasts : tuple of (str, str), optional
        Arm pairs ``(a, b)`` read "a predicted higher-alpha than b". Default the H2 contrasts.
    ladder : tuple, optional
        The factor ladder (default :data:`FACTOR_LADDER`).
    risk_free, hac_lag, n_boot, rng
        Forwarded to :func:`difference_in_alpha` / :func:`factor_alpha`.
    q : float, optional
        Benjamini-Hochberg FDR level for THIS secondary family (default 0.05).

    Returns
