"""Structural similarity of LLM-authored reward CODE — report-only mechanism enrichment (R68).

Closes the placebo construct-validity gap the audits flagged. The inert `placebo` and the `placebo_shuffled`
controls already neutralise *cosmetic-token* leakage, but they cannot show whether the language model
conditions the **program structure** of its reward on the fed signal. This module answers that directly and
*identifier-invariantly*: it canonicalises every reward's abstract syntax tree (variable/argument names and
constant VALUES are discarded — only the node-TYPE structure survives), enumerates the set of depth-bounded
subtree shapes (the "AST Distinct-N" signature; canonicalised subtree enumeration), and measures pairwise
Jaccard similarity. The headline statistic is **mean within-condition vs mean across-condition** structural
similarity, with a deterministic label-permutation test: if the LLM routes the fed tail signal into the
*shape* of the code it writes, rewards authored under the same feedback condition are structurally more
similar to each other than to rewards authored under other conditions.

Scope: report-only, DISJOINT from the frozen m=6 testing family; never gates a hypothesis. It is a stronger,
identifier-invariant companion to the reward-program differential (R51) — that one counts declared tail
constructs; this one tests whole-program structural clustering by condition. Pure standard-library `ast`
(+ numpy, already a dependency, for the seeded permutation test); fully DETERMINISTIC (no model, no GPU);
does not touch the numpy<2 / pandas<3 pins.
