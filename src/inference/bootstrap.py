"""Stationary-bootstrap inference for dependent return series (FINAL_PLAN F.11).

Purpose
-------
Provide block-resampling machinery and paired performance-difference tests that
remain valid under the serial correlation present in daily portfolio returns.
These tests back the headline pairwise comparisons between arms (distributional
vs scalar feedback) and feed the multiple-testing family in
``src.inference.multiple_testing``.

Why the stationary bootstrap
----------------------------
Daily P&L is autocorrelated (volatility clustering, momentum/mean-reversion),
so the iid bootstrap and naive t-tests understate sampling error. The
Politis-Romano (1994) stationary bootstrap resamples *blocks* of random,
geometrically distributed length with wrap-around, which preserves the
short-range dependence structure while keeping the resampled series stationary.

Algorithm (stationary bootstrap, index form)
---------------------------------------------
1. Draw a starting index uniformly in ``[0, n)``.
2. With probability ``p`` start a fresh block (draw a new uniform start); with
   probability ``1 - p`` continue the current block by stepping the index
   forward by one (mod ``n`` -- wrap-around).
3. Expected block length is ``1 / p``; block lengths are ``Geometric(p)``.
4. Repeat until ``n`` indices are produced -- that is one bootstrap path.

Difference tests
----------------
``sharpe_difference_test`` implements a *re-centred basic (empirical) stationary
block-bootstrap* test for ``H0: SR(a) - SR(b) = 0``: the two-sided p-value is the
bootstrap probability that the null-recentred difference ``boot - obs`` exceeds the
observed difference ``obs`` in absolute value. The test does **not** studentize:
although a bootstrap standard error ``se`` is computed and reported (as a scaled
``stat = obs / se``), it *cancels exactly* in the decision rule
``|(boot - obs) / se| >= |obs / se|`` (the ``se`` divides both sides), so the
p-value is identical to the un-studentized empirical-bootstrap p-value
``(|boot - obs| >= |obs|).mean()``. This is the *stationary* bootstrap of
Politis & Romano (**1994**, random geometric block lengths), chosen on its own
merits for autocorrelated returns. We deliberately do **not** claim the Ledoit &
Wolf (2008) studentized construction — LW use the *circular* block bootstrap of
Politis & Romano (**1992**, fixed block size) *and* a studentization that does not
cancel; our size is certified empirically by ``null_calibration`` (audit C-7)
rather than by appeal to that result.

``cvar_difference_test`` applies the analogous re-centred stationary-bootstrap
construction to the difference in CVaR (expected shortfall) at level ``alpha``.
No published difference-in-CVaR test was located, so this is a *bespoke*
extension whose size is likewise certified empirically by ``null_calibration``
(audit C-7) rather than by a citation.

``null_calibration`` repeatedly applies a difference test under a true null and
reports the empirical rejection rate at the 5% level together with the raw
p-values, certifying that the test machinery is correctly sized (audit C-7).

    return series (``paired_seed_difference_test``), which carries the true sampling variance directly
    and never relies on this annualised scalar. The annualised Sharpe is reported as a descriptive

    losses differ — the same re-centred stationary block-bootstrap construction as
