"""N3 contamination harness — the named-vs-blinded A/B (PREREGISTRATION §8, deep-research §5.9).

What this measures, and what it deliberately does NOT
-----------------------------------------------------
The leakage risk for an LLM *reward designer* (NOT a forecaster) is **concept
leakage**: priors that CVaR/drawdown-penalised reward terms work on famous regimes,
plus implicit coefficient-tuning toward crisis dates the model has read about. It is
**not** outcome recall — the reward sees only anonymised arrays (no tickers, no dates;
``src/reward/contract.py`` lines 18-19). So the question is not "did the model memorise
a label" but "does revealing the identity of the data change the reward code it writes,
*holding the data itself fixed*."

The **named-vs-blinded A/B** answers exactly that and is the load-bearing test:

* **Factor 1 — identity revelation.** NAMED (real dates / ticker labels / regime names
  exposed in the prompt) vs BLINDED (the anonymised arrays the live pipeline actually
  feeds).
* **Factor 2 — regime content held FIXED.** Both arms see the *identical* numerical
  arrays; only the surrounding labels differ. Because the data is identical across arms,
  the comparison **escapes the membership-inference (MIA) distribution-shift confound**
  that invalidates almost all post-hoc contamination claims (Meeus et al. 2024, "SoK:
  MIAs on LLMs are Rushing Nowhere", arXiv:2406.17975: post-hoc member/non-member splits
  carry a strong distribution shift; Duan et al. 2024, arXiv:2402.07841: MIAs barely beat
  chance at frontier scale). Here the only thing that varies is the label, so a measured
  difference is *concept use*, not a distribution artefact.

The dependent variable is the **reward-coefficient vector** ``theta`` extracted from each
authored reward (a probe-regression coefficient vector is the primary instrument; a static
AST/structural read corroborates), plus a **structural binary vector** ``s`` (which reward
*motifs* appear: a CVaR term, a drawdown term, a turnover penalty, ...).

**The primary statistic is a paired TOST equivalence test, per coefficient.** For each
coefficient ``k`` we test whether the named-minus-blinded paired mean difference lies inside
``[-Delta_k, +Delta_k]`` with ``Delta_k = equivalence_sd_frac * (within-arm seed SD)``
(Lakens 2017; Schuirmann 1987). Rejecting *both* one-sided nulls licenses the positive claim
**"the coefficient is invariant to identity revelation within +/-Delta"** — i.e.
**bounded contamination stated as a positive result**, not the absence-of-evidence non-result
a bare two-sided p>0.05 would be. (TOST p-value = max of the two one-sided p-values; the 90%
CI lies inside the bounds at the 5% level.)

What is LOAD-BEARING vs THEATRE (state this in the write-up; do not blur it)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
* LOAD-BEARING: the named-vs-blinded A/B (this module's primary), post-cutoff persistence of
  the H2 gap (:func:`post_cutoff_persistence`), and a cutoff-dated second model
  (:func:`cross_model_disagreement`). These have a realised, comparable target.
* THEATRE / CATEGORY ERROR (deliberately NOT implemented here): Min-K%-prob or
  loss/perplexity attacks "on the reward function". There is no realised target token
  sequence to score — the reward is *generated*, not *recalled* — so a per-token membership
  score has no estimand. MIA on Opus closed-weight logprobs (only top-k logprobs exposed,
  no reference model) barely beats chance (Duan 2024). Structural blinding itself is
  **mixed-effectiveness hygiene** (Glasserman-Lin 2023: anonymisation removes *distraction*,
  not look-ahead; Sarkar-Vafa: masking can be defeated by reconstruction) — *necessary*, but
  its *sufficiency* is the empirical question this A/B answers, not an assumption.

Degrades gracefully
-------------------
Every public function returns a structured ``dict`` and **never fabricates**: when the
campaign artefacts (named/blinded coefficient archives, pre/post-cutoff per-seed records,
a second model's coefficients) are absent, it returns ``{"status": "no_data", ...}`` with the
reason. The wiring contract for the campaign is in ``docs/CAMPAIGN_contamination_ood.md``.

    Tests ``H01: mean(named - blinded) <= low`` and ``H02: mean(named - blinded) >= high``
    on the paired differences ``d = named - blinded`` (paired element-wise by SEED). The
    equivalence p-value is the **maximum** of the two one-sided p-values; equivalence at level
    ``alpha`` is declared (``equivalent=True``) iff that p-value ``< alpha`` is decided by the
    caller, but the convention is exposed via the 90% CI: ``equivalent`` here means *both*
    one-sided tests reject at 0.05 (i.e. the 90% CI ``[ci_low, ci_high]`` lies strictly inside
    ``(low, high)``), the standard TOST decision (Lakens 2017; Schuirmann 1987).

    Parameters
    ----------
    named, blinded : np.ndarray
        Paired samples (same length; element ``i`` is the same seed). For the A/B these are a
        single coefficient's value across seeds in the NAMED vs BLINDED arm.

        ``low``); ``p_upper`` tests ``H02`` (diff below ``high``). The 90% CI is the
        equi-tailed t interval used in the standard TOST<->CI duality.

    ``named_coeffs`` / ``blinded_coeffs`` are ``(n_seeds, n_coeffs)`` coefficient matrices: row
    = seed (paired across the two arms), column = a reward-coefficient ``theta_k`` (probe-
    regression coefficient primary; AST corroboration). The arms are the SAME data with only
    the identity labels differing, so a coefficient that is **equivalent within +/-Delta_k**
    demonstrates **bounded concept-contamination as a positive claim**.

    The per-coefficient bound is ``Delta_k = equivalence_sd_frac * sd_k`` where ``sd_k`` is the
    pooled within-arm seed SD of coefficient ``k`` (deep-research §5.9: half the seed-to-seed
    noise) — UNLESS an explicit ``equivalence_abs`` vector is supplied (pre-registered absolute
    bounds), which then overrides the data-driven width.

    POWER WARNING (load-bearing limitation, not a bug). With ``Delta = 0.5 * SD`` the equivalence
    bound is TIGHT: at the tier-0 floor (n=30) the 90% CI half-width on the paired
    mean difference is comparable to ``Delta``, so a genuinely null (label-irrelevant) coefficient
    will typically NOT clear the bound — a measured ``all_equivalent = False`` at n=30 is
    underpowered, NOT evidence of contamination. The named-vs-blinded A/B is a CHEAP dedicated
    sub-experiment (one reward authoring + one cheap eval per seed; it does NOT re-run the 50k-step
    main training), so it should run more seeds than the tier-0 floor (empirically ~150-200 seeds
    give >0.95 power for the all-coefficient claim at ``Delta = 0.5 * SD``). Report the per-
    coefficient CIs and the achieved power, and pre-register either the seed count or a wider
    ``Delta`` — do not silently read a low-power non-rejection as contamination.

    Notes
    -----
    No multiplicity correction is applied to the *equivalence* decisions here: TOST controls the

    per-coefficient invariance. A family-level summary (``fraction_equivalent``) is reported; if

    The coefficient TOST and per-motif McNemar above test *what coefficients / which motifs* the reward
    carries; this tests the **whole-program structure**, identifier- and literal-invariantly, by reusing the
    canonical AST-shape similarity (:mod:`src.inference.reward_code_distance` — variable names and constant
    values are discarded, so cosmetic renaming is invisible). It is the structural complement that closes the
    gap the audits flagged: a placebo can echo the tail *tokens* yet still write a different *program*.

    Paired by seed: ``named_sources[i]`` and ``blinded_sources[i]`` are the rewards authored for the SAME seed
    on the SAME numerical arrays under the NAMED vs BLINDED labelling. Two quantities are contrasted:

    * ``paired_mean`` — mean same-seed ``sim(named_i, blinded_i)``: the structural agreement that survives
      revealing identity, holding the data fixed;
    * ``within_blinded_mean`` — mean cross-seed ``sim(blinded_i, blinded_j)`` (``i<j``): the natural
      seed-to-seed structural variation under a FIXED labelling — the noise floor.

    If the label is irrelevant to program structure, revealing identity perturbs structure NO MORE than
    reseeding does, so ``paired_mean >= within_blinded_mean`` (``data_locked``). A re-pairing permutation test
    (random named→blinded bijections) reports ``p_random_pairing_matches`` — the probability a random pairing
    is as structurally tight as the true same-seed pairing; a SMALL value means the same-data programs are
    distinctly tighter than chance, i.e. structure is driven by the shared data, **evidence AGAINST structural
    contamination**. A ``paired_mean`` that collapses to the noise floor (large p) would instead flag
    identity-driven structure. Report-only, DISJOINT from the frozen m=6 family; deterministic (no model/GPU).
