"""Multiple-testing corrections across the arm x metric family (FINAL_PLAN F.11, audit B-8).

Purpose
-------
Control the family-wise error rate / false-discovery rate over the family of
hypotheses formed by the cross-product of arms and held-out metrics.

Methods
-------
- ``benjamini_hochberg`` -- the Benjamini-Hochberg (1995) linear step-up
  procedure controlling the false-discovery rate at level ``q``.
- ``romano_wolf`` -- the Romano & Wolf (2005) stepdown procedure for strong
  control of the family-wise error rate, using a bootstrap null distribution of
  the test statistics (via the max statistic) to account for dependence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvals:
        One p-value per hypothesis.
    q:
        Target false-discovery rate. The default MIRRORS the registered value
        (``config/inference.yaml: multiplicity.q = 0.05``) — it was ``0.1`` until
        2026-07-26, i.e. TWICE the pre-registered FDR, so any caller that omitted ``q``
        would silently have run a more permissive correction than the design registers.
        The change is behaviour-free today (every call site in ``src/``, ``scripts/`` and
        ``tests/`` passes ``q`` explicitly, so the default was unreachable) and removes the
        trap for future callers. ``config/inference.yaml`` remains the single source of
        truth; production code must keep passing it explicitly rather than lean on this.

    r"""Sequentially-rejective graphical multiple test (Bretz, Maurer, Brannath & Posch 2009).

    THE REGISTERED PRIMARY DECISION RULE. ``config/preregistration.yaml:
    inference.validity_tier`` declares ``method: graphical_bretz_maurer_brannath_posch_2009`` and
    ``primary_rule: bonferroni_weighted_graph``, ratified 2026-07-26 (R108) — which SUPERSEDED R31's
    separate-estimands stance. Until this function existed the pipeline could not execute the rule it
    is registered to run (deep review 2026-07-26, write-time registry row 36): the analysis computed
    only the Bonferroni-over-4 mirror, i.e. the *superseded* stance.

    Because a graphical procedure is a shortcut for a CLOSED test (Marcus, Peritz & Gabriel 1976), the
    whole family enjoys **strong FWER control at ``alpha`` under arbitrary dependence** — which is why
    the H2 co-primaries may be tested at ``w_i·alpha`` without any further leg correction inside each
    IUT (Berger 1982 already makes each node's max-p a valid level-alpha p-value).

    Algorithm (eq. (2)-(3) of Bretz et al. 2009). With index set ``J`` of not-yet-rejected nodes:

      1. reject any ``j in J`` with ``p_j <= w_j * alpha``; if none, stop;
      2. propagate the rejected node's weight   ``w_l += w_j * g_jl``            for ``l in J\{j}``;
      3. re-wire                                ``g_lk = (g_lk + g_lj*g_jk) / (1 - g_lj*g_jl)``
         (``0`` when ``g_lj*g_jl >= 1``; ``g_ll = 0``), drop ``j`` from ``J``, and repeat.

    **The rejected SET is invariant to the order** in which simultaneously-rejectable nodes are taken —
    a property of the closed-test shortcut, exercised directly by
    ``tests/test_graphical_alpha.py::test_rejected_set_is_order_invariant``. This implementation
    nevertheless picks a DETERMINISTIC order (smallest p first, ties broken by the caller's node order)
    so a run is byte-reproducible.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pvalues:
        Node p-value per node id. ``None``/NaN means the node was NOT TESTABLE (e.g. an arm with too
        few shared seeds). Such a node can never reject and is reported under ``untestable`` — it is
        NOT silently treated as a passing test.
    weights, edges:
        The graph. **Callers must READ these from the registered config, never hardcode them** — the
        graph is declared FROZEN by ``validity_tier.forking_path_guard``, and a hardcoded copy is
        exactly the executed-vs-registered drift the arm-roster / ``h1_baselines`` /
        ``confirmatory_author`` freeze guards exist to prevent. Use :func:`registered_alpha_graph`.
    alpha:
        Family-wise error rate. The registered value is 0.05.
