"""Assemble the six confirmatory node p-values and run the RATIFIED graphical decision rule.

Bridges what ``scripts/analyze_campaign.py`` already computes to
``multiple_testing.graphical_alpha_propagation`` — the rule ratified 2026-07-26 (R108:
``primary_rule: bonferroni_weighted_graph``, superseding R31).

WHY A SEPARATE MODULE. The rule must be executable and testable WITHOUT campaign data, and the graph
must be READ from the registered config rather than copied (``forking_path_guard`` declares it FROZEN).
So ``analyze_campaign`` needs exactly one call, and this logic is unit-tested today — before any results
exist, which is precisely when a decision rule is allowed to be written.

FAIL-SAFE BY CONSTRUCTION. A node whose p-value cannot be located is reported ``untestable`` and can
never reject; it is NEVER silently treated as a pass or a fail. Every path searched is recorded, so a
shape mismatch surfaces in the artifact instead of producing a confidently wrong confirmatory verdict —
the worst possible failure here.

NODE MAP — every path below was VERIFIED against the producing code, not inferred from docstrings
(the 2026-07-26 deep review found 4 of 6 first-guess paths wrong, which is why this is spelled out):

===============  ==========================================================  =======================
node             source in ``out``                                            rule

N4_h4            ``out["h4"]["tests"][*]["pvalue_one_sided"]``                MAX over legs (IUT)
N5_structure     ``out["h2_structure"]["cvar"]["pvalue_one_sided"]``          single test (metric: cvar)
N6_h1            ``out["h1_beat_human"]["iut"]["iut_pvalue"]``                ALREADY the MAX over the
                                                                              canon, gated on
                                                                              ``all_baselines_present``
===============  ==========================================================  =======================

N5 reads the **cvar** sub-result because the registered node is
``{test: distributional_gt_placebo_shuffled, metric: cvar, level: 0.05}``. N6 reuses the pipeline's own
``iut_pvalue`` and honours ``all_baselines_present``: dominance is certifiable only when every canon
member is testable, so a missing member yields ``untestable`` rather than a cheaper claim.

★ N2 AND THE A16 CORRECTION (2026-08-01, RUN 11) — READ THIS BEFORE CHANGING N2's KEY.
The registered node is ``{test: h2_ra_iut_or_tost, equivalence: tost_0.05_dsr}``, and the same frozen
block records "alpha recycled on ANY rejection (superiority OR equivalence)" and, in its own dated
note, "activation rests entirely on N2 rejecting via TOST — a real pre-registered alpha source".
Until today this module read ``pvalue_one_sided`` — the SUPERIORITY leg only — so the registered
disjunction had **no implementation at all**. Under the design's OWN predicted branch (Sharpe tie AND
tail tie) N1 cannot reject, so with N2 unable to reject either, ALL SIX nodes were unreachable and
four hypotheses had no confirmatory decision path.

The repair is CONFORMANCE, not an amendment: ``{theta > 0} UNION {-d < theta < d}`` IS
``{theta > -d}``, so "superiority or equivalence" is ONE hypothesis and it is exactly non-inferiority
at the SESOI. Nothing frozen changes.

TWO THINGS THIS MODULE MUST NOT LET A LATER READER FORGET:
  1. Over THREE legs, ``AND_j {theta_j > -d}`` is STRICTLY WEAKER than
     ``(AND_j {theta_j > 0}) OR (AND_j {|theta_j| < d})`` — it also fires at "superior on two legs,
     mildly inferior on the third". So N2's claim is WRITTEN as one-sided NON-INFERIORITY at the
     SESOI, **never** as "superior or equivalent".
  2. The registered margin is the PERMISSIVE one. ``n2_key`` therefore exists so the caller can
     report the pre-specified sensitivities — the conservative margin and the as-implemented-until-
     now superiority rule — ALONGSIDE the primary. All three were fixed in advance, on the record,
     while 0 of 3 H2-RA legs were computable (2026-08-01T13:01:15Z, HEAD 57c5ecc4), so which one
     rejects cannot select the claim.
