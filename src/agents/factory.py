"""RL agent factories for the headline and distributional critics.

Purpose
-------
Construct the two reinforcement-learning agents compared in the dissertation
(FINAL_PLAN F.7). To keep the comparison fair, both factories must be invoked
with an identical environment, training budget, and seed schedule wherever the
two agents are compared head to head -- only the *algorithm/critic* differs.

Agents
------
    make_headline_agent      : Stable-Baselines3 SAC. This is the FIXED
                               headline algorithm used everywhere the reward is
                               the object of study (audit A-1) -- the reward
                               changes, the agent does not.
    make_distributional_agent: sb3_contrib TQC, the distributional/secondary
                               critic (audit A-2). TQC truncates the top
                               quantiles of its critic ensemble; the contrast
                               with SAC is therefore precisely *mean critic vs
                               truncated-quantile critic*, with library, entropy
                               coefficient, and hyperparameters held fixed.

Heavy optional dependencies
---------------------------
``stable-baselines3`` / ``sb3-contrib`` (and their ``torch`` backend) are heavy
optional dependencies. They are imported LAZILY inside each factory so this
module -- and the deterministic core that imports it -- loads cleanly without
torch installed. When a factory is actually invoked without the relevant
package present, it raises a clear :class:`RuntimeError` naming the package.

Tests (tests/test_agents.py)
----------------------------
    - make_headline_agent / make_distributional_agent raise the documented
      RuntimeError naming stable-baselines3 / sb3-contrib when those packages
      are absent.
    - the dispatcher rejects an unknown kind with ValueError.
    - the module imports cleanly without torch installed.
