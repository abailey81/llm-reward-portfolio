"""SAC trainer — builds the FIXED headline agent and trains it on a reward-bound env.

``make_agent_trainer(cfg, seed) -> (train_env -> policy)`` is the ``agent_trainer`` the
discovery loop (``src/llm/loop.py``) injects, and ``train_agent`` is the standalone
trainer the search-arm evaluator (``src/agents/evaluator.py``) uses. The agent is a
single SB3 SAC (Haarnoja et al. 2018; audit A-1) whose ARCHITECTURE and HYPERPARAMETERS
are held fixed across arms (see :func:`resolve_agent_kwargs`) so that performance
differences are attributable to the *reward*, not the learner. One precise caveat: with
``ent_coef="auto"`` and the PopArt scale-normalisation (fact 3 below), the *effective entropy
regularisation* can vary with the authored reward magnitude — so "fixed agent" means fixed
architecture+hyperparameters, not a fixed effective regulariser. This is made auditable by the
per-candidate ``sigma_max`` logging (``src/agents/popart.py``, amendment R48) and bounded by the
``popart=False`` ablation (``scripts/popart_ablation.py``); both the cross-arm ``sigma_max`` table
and the ablation REQUIRE the campaign run (not yet executed).

Two engineering facts, each load-bearing (MASTER_EXECUTION_PLAN §5, deep-research §2):

1. **Memory-safe replay buffer (ADR-025).** SB3's default ``buffer_size=1_000_000`` at
   the 1,893-dim observation needs ``1e6 x 1893 x 4 B x 2 ~= 15 GB`` of CPU RAM — it
   would OOM a 16 GB laptop. The buffer is sized to the (fixed, matched) per-candidate
   step budget instead (``buffer_size = train_steps``), ~0.76 GB at 50k
   (50000 x 1893 x 4 B x 2, the same obs+next_obs float32 allocation the 15 GB figure
   above assumes). We do **not** use ``optimize_memory_usage=True`` (its
   handle-timeout-termination caveat is unsafe at our split-boundary episode
   truncation — review m1).

2. **Train-only observation normalization (deep-research §2).** The 1,893-dim obs mixes
   returns (~1e-3), realized vol (~1e-2), lagged VIX (~10-80) and weights (0-1); SAC is
   sensitive to that scale spread. We wrap the *training* env in SB3 ``VecNormalize``
   (``norm_obs=True``), then **freeze** the running statistics and carry them on the
   returned :class:`NormalizedPolicy`, which re-applies the *same train-period* stats at
   evaluation time. We deliberately keep ``norm_reward=False`` — the reward is the object
   of study and must not be rescaled by the trainer (that would distort H2). Entropy
   auto-tuning (``ent_coef="auto"``) further adapts to the reward scale.

3. **PopArt-style value-target scale normalization (the engine gap; src/agents/popart.py).** An
   LLM-authored reward can emit a ``total`` of almost any scale (a Sharpe that divides a one-step
   return by a variance floored at ``1e-8`` peaks at ``|total| ~ 1e4``; verified prototype candidate
   ``scalar-g5-c3``). SAC's Bellman backup turns a target of magnitude ``R`` into a Q-target near
   ``R/(1-gamma) ~ 1e6`` (``gamma=0.99``) and the MSE critic loss explodes to ``~5e6`` at the LAST
   training step (``outputs/prototype/anomalies.jsonl``). We make the critic invariant to reward
   *scale* by dividing ONLY the learning signal by a running scale ``sqrt(EMA[r^2])`` — at constant
   scale a positive affine map of the value function, leaving the optimal policy unchanged (van
   Hasselt et al. 2016); the implemented EMA scale drifts (buffered rewards keep their
   collection-time scaling), so it is approximately policy-preserving — see ``src/agents/popart.py``'s
   honest-scope note + the ``popart=False`` ablation — while the regression target is held at unit
   scale. ``info["port_ret"]`` (the object of study) is
   forwarded UNCHANGED, so ``norm_reward`` stays False and every realized-return number we analyse is
   identical. Config-gated by ``popart`` (default on); applied identically across arms.

All behaviours are config-gated; ``normalize_obs`` and ``popart`` default on. ``learning_starts``
defaults to 1000 (the value the Phase-0 GATE validated; SB3's UNSET default is 100, so leaving it
unset would run a DIFFERENT warmup than the gate proved).
