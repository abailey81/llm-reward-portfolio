"""k-seed search-candidate aggregation (B-A2 — the σ_seed selection-noise denoiser).

The σ_D pilot MEASURED that seed-to-seed noise (σ_seed≈0.244) dominates the SESOI, and that noise
enters the study TWICE: once at selection (which candidate wins) and once at the test leg. The test
leg is already denoised by the uniform-n seeds; this closes the SELECTION channel — each search
candidate is trained at ``k`` seeds ``{run_seed, run_seed+1, …, run_seed+k-1}`` and evaluated on the
**IQM** of its per-seed scores, so the winner (and the LLM's reflection target) is a k-seed aggregate,
not a single lucky/unlucky draw. Strictly exceeds Eureka's 1-policy-per-reward selection rigor.

DECIDED semantics (PLAN §12 B-A2), implemented here as the SINGLE source both the cluster and laptop
search paths call (so they cannot drift):

* **valid iff ALL k seeds ok** — a candidate with any failed seed is FAILED into the matched-budget
  ledger (no partial-aggregate that would bias selection toward lucky-subset candidates);
* **fitness = IQM of the k per-seed ``val_fitness``** (``src.inference.bootstrap.iqm``) — the SELECTION
  metric AND the LLM reflection metric;
* **PBO vector = per-period MEAN of the k seeds' ``val_returns``** (same T; the per-candidate series
  the DSR/PBO machinery consumes);
* **fed tail block = the 6 frozen stats recomputed on the CONCATENATION of the k seeds' TRAIN-window
  returns** (``metrics.train_returns``, emitted by the worker under the k>1 specs' ``emit_train_returns``
  flag and archived alongside ``val_returns``).

FED-TAIL WINDOW — DECIDED 2026-07-08 (Tamer delegated: "whatever maximises publishability/grade").
The k-seed fed tail is fit on the **TRAIN** window, matching the single-seed construct exactly
(``parallel.train_candidate``: ``ReturnDistribution().fit(train)``; the estimator's own signature is
``fit(train_realized_returns)``). Rationale: the ratified design is **fed in-sample / scored
out-of-sample** — a named selection-overfitting defense (CH4 threats table; CLAUDE.md's endogeneity
honesty block). Feeding VAL-derived tails would hand the author richer information about the SELECTION
set (more overfitting pressure) and make the k=1 and k>1 constructs inconsistent. The plan §12 B-A2
draft said "val" — a drafting slip, corrected there with a dated note. Net k=3 claim for the paper:
the fed tail is estimated on 3× the in-sample data (better EVT reliability), construct unchanged.
