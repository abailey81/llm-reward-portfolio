"""Random search over the reward CODE space (LLM-free control; H4a).

Purpose
-------
A non-LLM control arm (FINAL_PLAN F.10, hypothesis H4a). It samples reward
functions uniformly at random from a fixed grammar (no model in the loop) and
scores them under the MATCHED candidate budget. Its role is to be a *procedure*
control at COMPARABLE expressive power to the Bayesian-optimisation arm (H4b):
both H4a and H4b draw from the SAME six-primitive reward family, so the H4a-vs-LLM
contrast isolates *proposal quality* rather than rewarding the LLM merely for a
richer reward language.

What this arm CAN and CANNOT isolate (state this precisely; see docs/DEEP_H4.md §1-2)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- It DOES give a procedure-only comparison against H4b: random-search and BO now
  search the identical six-term family at the identical fixed discrete dims, so
  any H4b-vs-H4a difference is surrogate-vs-uniform, not space-vs-space.
- It does NOT match the LLM's search SPACE: the LLM authors FREE-FORM code (tanh,
  ratios, regime switches, Sortino-style asymmetries — none reachable by a fixed
  six-term linear combination). So a positive H4a reflects *proposal quality at
  comparable-but-not-identical richness*, and the residual richness gap (free-form
  vs six-term) is part of what H4b measures. Do NOT claim H4a proves the LLM is a
  better optimiser over an identical space.
- Random search is a deliberately STRONG baseline (Bergstra & Bengio 2012): a weak
  control would make a positive H4a trivially true and therefore uninformative.

The code grammar (the SHARED six-primitive family)
--------------------------------------------------
Every sampled reward is the SAME six-term linear family the BO arm searches
(``src/baselines/reward_family.py``), rendered to executable source via
:func:`reward_family.params_to_source` so its form is byte-identical to the BO
arm's materialised winner (same numpy ops, same gate-clean status, same
``(hist, peak, cum)`` reward_state):

    r = w_return*net_return + w_log*log1p(net_return)
        - w_turnover*turnover - w_drawdown*drawdown
        - w_cvar*max(0, -CVaR_alpha) - w_vol*sigma

The six non-negative weights are drawn from a coarse per-primitive grid spanning
the SAME frozen ``[low, high]`` ranges as the BO box (``family_bounds``); the two
discrete dims (``cvar_alpha``, ``window``) are FIXED at the same values the BO arm
freezes (0.05, 20) so the two H4 arms share an identical search space. The grid is
non-negative-only, so every penalty term acts as a penalty (a *risk-aware* random
baseline, matching the LLM's and the family's risk-aware intent — disclose this; it
is favourable to the control, not unfair).

Algorithm (FINAL_PLAN F.10, H4a)
--------------------------------
    1. For each of ``candidate_budget`` units, sample a six-weight vector from the
       per-primitive grid and render the family reward source.
    2. Gate + validate the source via ``src.sandbox.executor`` (skip-and-log
       gate failures; they do NOT consume a budget unit — we keep sampling until
       the full matched budget of *valid* candidates has been evaluated).
    3. Score each validated reward with the injected ``fitness_fn`` (which maps a
       reward callable to a held-out score; deterministic in the tests).
    4. Track the best candidate; stop when the matched budget is exhausted.
    5. Return the best reward + an archive of every evaluated candidate.

The search BUDGET is unchanged by the grammar widening (still exactly
``matched_budget`` valid candidates), so matched compute with the LLM / BO arms
holds.

Tests (tests/test_search.py)
----------------------------
    - returns a valid (gate-passing) best reward and consumes EXACTLY the matched
      budget;
    - every sampled source passes ``ast_gate`` and is six-term family code.

    -----
    Gate/validation failures are skipped without consuming a budget unit, so the
    search always evaluates EXACTLY ``budget`` valid candidates (matched compute
    is invariant to the grammar). The grammar renders the six-term reward family
    via ``reward_family.params_to_source``, which is gate-clean by construction
    (numpy-only allowlisted ops, no imports, no dunders); the assertion in the
    loop is a defensive invariant, not an expected branch.
