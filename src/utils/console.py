"""Never let the console codepage kill a run.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-27 — observed, not hypothesised). ``scripts/bank_gate.py`` died with
``UnicodeEncodeError`` while **printing a log tail** — not while analysing anything. It reads
subprocess output with ``errors="replace"``, which injects U+FFFD, and this box's console is
**cp1251**, which has no mapping for that character. So the POST-CAMPAIGN analysis runsheet was
killed by a console codepage: the most expensive possible moment in the whole project to lose.

The exposure is systemic, not incidental. Launch-critical scripts print status decorated with
characters cp1251 cannot encode (``→ ★ ≥ ⚠``, plus U+FFFD from any replace-read), and a crash in
``freeze.py`` (GO step 1), ``run_campaign_cluster.py`` (the launcher) or ``sentinel.py`` (the
whole-campaign monitor) costs far more than the cosmetic problem it looks like. Note cp1251 *does*
map the em-dash, which is why this stayed hidden for so long — only the rarer glyphs bite.

**Call from ``main()``, never at import.** Reconfiguring a global stream as an import side effect
would surprise every importer and every test that captures output — and several of these scripts
are imported by ``run_campaign.py`` and by the suite.

The encoding choice matches the idiom already used inline by ``analyze_campaign``/``monitor``/
``build_paper``/``allocation_advisor``/``resume_brief``; those five predate this helper and are
deliberately left alone rather than churned.
