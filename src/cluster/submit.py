"""Submission layer: push batches up (tar-over-ssh), qsub arrays, marker jobs for hold-chains (§12.4/§14.3).

Every function takes a ``runner`` callable (``runner(cmd: list[str]) -> str`` returning stdout)
so tests inject a fake and NOTHING here touches the network at import or test time. Production
passes :func:`ssh_runner` (the ``myriad`` Host alias — key auth, keepalives from ~/.ssh/config;
credentials never appear here, R10).

Researched rules encoded: one ARRAY = one queue entry (R3: never loop qsub); submit-rate safety
via a single qsub per batch; ``-hold_jid`` released by 5-minute MARKER jobs so dependent arrays
are pre-submitted with ZERO driver latency (§14.3); job ids parsed from Grid Engine's canonical
"Your job[-array] <id>" line.

#: Wall-clock bound on ONE driver ssh call. Lowered 300 -> 120 on 2026-07-28 after measuring where
#: the 300 s "timeouts" actually go.
#:
#: MEASURED, on the live RUN 2 driver: over 55 samples in three minutes, only 8 distinct ssh
#: children existed and **not one ever aged past 10 s** — while the driver logged a 300 s timeout
#: roughly every five minutes, on ops as trivial as `mkdir -p`. The remote side is not the cause
#: either (`qstat -r` 1.2 s, `find` over the whole outputs tree 0.046 s, login-node load 3.4), nor
#: is the client (sustained 8-concurrent A/B of Windows OpenSSH 9.5p2 vs Git's 10.2p1: 80/80 ok on
#: both, worst case 6.0 s). So the wait is happening in the PARENT — `subprocess.run`'s pipe
#: reader never observing EOF — and the log message misattributes it to the remote command.
#:
#: The exact parent-side mechanism is NOT yet identified, so this is a BOUND, not a cure: it caps
#: the cost of each event at 120 s instead of 300 s and returns the batch thread to work 2.5x
#: sooner. 120 s is ~20x the measured worst-case real latency, so it cannot truncate a legitimate
#: call. The pull path is unaffected (it uses its own Popen with a 3600 s budget for a bulk tar).

    2026-07-28 LEAK FIX, found live at T+11 h of the confirmatory run. Both tar-over-ssh pipes in
    this package (:func:`push_batch` here, ``poll._default_fetch`` on the pull side) placed their
    ``proc.wait()`` AFTER the ``try/finally``. Any exception on the consuming side therefore

    ``TimeoutExpired`` by construction, so the leak fired on exactly the path that mattered.

    This is not tidiness. Each leaked ``ssh`` holds an established session on the SHARED UCL login
    node plus a remote ``tar``, and login-node session pressure is what makes the NEXT pull stall:
    a positive feedback loop. Measured on the live campaign at T+11 h — 13 leaked children, 8 of
    them pulls still running 1.1-6.7 h past their own 3600 s timeout, against a driver transport
    failure rate climbing monotonically 5.2 % -> 55.3 % over ten hours while successful poll cycles
