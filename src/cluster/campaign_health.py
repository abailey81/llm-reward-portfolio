"""CAMPAIGN-LANE HEALTH — the five failure modes the existing sentinel cannot see.

``scripts/sentinel.py`` already covers the MACHINE and the RUN well (disk, RAM, silent hang, gate
failure rate, NaN/divergence rates, reward-scale drift, API errors, driver lease, queue health,
completion stall). What it has no visibility into is the thing that actually decides whether the
2026-07-26 CPU-lane campaign succeeds: **are we holding the capacity we assumed, is the critical
path advancing, and is the substrate staying homogeneous?**

Each function is PURE (no disk, no ssh) so it is unit-testable, and each returns the sentinel's own
``HealthCheck`` vocabulary so these compose into the existing report and alerting rather than
forming a second, parallel monitor.

THE FIVE, and why each earns its place — every one is a failure that would otherwise be SILENT:

1. :func:`check_capacity_accumulation` — the campaign plan's one UNMEASURED assumption is that
   ~8.5 h tasks ACCUMULATE to far more than the 636 cores measured with 20-min probes. If instead
   concurrency plateaus low, the reachable seed rung falls and we must know on DAY ONE, not at the
   Aug-27 stop. Compares the observed curve to the forecast and says which.
2. :func:`check_chain_progress` — the makespan is ``max(throughput, longest serial chain)``. The
   `bayes_opt` (25 serial) and TPE (20 serial) chains FLOOR the campaign, so a stalled chain wastes
   the whole run even while thousands of test-leg trainings stream in and every other indicator
   looks green. Nothing else watches the critical path.
3. :func:`check_host_failure_concentration` — a SINGLE bad node silently eats tasks. We measured
   this for real: ``node-d00a-230`` had no apptainer and returned rc=127 on every task routed to
   it. A global failure RATE hides it; concentration by host exposes it.
4. :func:`check_rung_forecast` — re-forecasts the reachable rung from the OBSERVED completion rate
   instead of the model, so the exogenous Aug-27 stop is planned against reality.
5. :func:`check_determinism_homogeneity` — CPU/CUDA and 1-thread/8-thread are not bit-identical,
   and every paired contrast depends on CRN pairing. The env fingerprint now records device and
   thread regime; this makes a mix visible DURING the run rather than at the post-hoc S6 audit,
   when it would be too late to re-run.

    `sentinel.check_completion_stall` watches the campaign's OVERALL cadence, so with nine arms and

    contributes ~1/19th of the flow and the global rate still looks fine. That arm can be silent for
    a day before anything notices, and its seeds are simply missing at the end.

    DIFFERENTIAL rather than threshold-based, deliberately: the absolute completion rate swings with
    granted capacity, so any fixed "expected records per hour" would be wrong all the time. Judging
    each arm against its SIBLINGS is robust to that — they share the same cluster, the same hour and
    the same scheduler.

    Alarms only on the conjunction of BEHIND and SILENT: an arm that has produced fewer records than
    its peers AND has gone much staler than them. An arm that is merely FINISHED is behind on
    nothing and is correctly ignored.

    ``per_arm`` maps arm -> ``{"n_records": int, "hours_since_last": float}``.

    SERIAL-CHAIN ARMS ARE EXCLUDED (2026-07-28). ``bayes_opt``/``tpe``/``cma_es`` advance ONE
    training per chain step (~8.5 h at 1 thread), while the LLM legs fan out five candidates per
    generation and emit a record every ~0.2 h. Judged against those siblings a chain arm is
    permanently "behind AND silent" — by construction, not by fault — which is exactly what fired
    live: ``ARM STALLED: cma_es (1 records, silent 4.0h vs peers ~0.2h); tpe (1 records, silent
    4.2h)`` while both were verifiably running with fresh heartbeats and live jobs. The differential
    premise ("siblings share the same hour and scheduler") holds only among arms with the same
    PARALLELISM, so the chains are judged instead by :func:`check_chain_progress`, whose 14 h/28 h
    thresholds are anchored on that measured step cost. Excluding them here removes a duplicate,
    mis-calibrated alarm rather than removing coverage. Names come from ``lanes.SERIAL_CHAIN_STEPS``
