"""Render the §14.6 Myriad jobscript (Grid Engine array) — the ONE template every batch uses.

Encodes every researched rule/lever: ``#!/bin/bash -l`` (R13), per-core ``-l mem`` (R13),
``$TMPDIR`` gold staging (§14.2), ``-r y`` native resume (§14.1), the ``-p`` intra-user
priority ladder (§14.3), ``-hold_jid`` pipelining, organized ``-o`` logs, ``umask 077`` (§14.5),
the per-task epilogue ledger line (§14.4), and §15 GPU packing via ``run_one --pack``.

ALWAYS write the rendered text to disk via :func:`write_jobscript` (V11 audit fix): the driver
runs on Windows, where a bare ``write_text`` translates ``\\n`` to ``\\r\\n`` — and a CRLF
shebang (``#!/bin/bash -l\\r``) makes qsub/exec fail on the cluster. The classic landmine,
killed at the API level.

PATH CONTRACT (2026-07-11 incident fix): every path handed to :func:`render_jobscript` must be
**tilde-free**, and ``remote_root`` must be **absolute**. ``~`` is expanded by NOTHING this
template touches: SGE ``#$`` directives (``-wd``/``-o``) expand neither ``~`` nor ``$HOME``
(an invalid ``-wd`` puts the whole array in ``Eqw`` at dispatch, where UCL's cleanup deletes it
with NO qacct record — the observed fate of the 2026-07-11 rehearsal), double-quoted bash
strings keep ``~`` literal (``mkdir -p "~/..."`` creates a directory named ``~``; the Apptainer
``--bind`` list fails on the nonexistent literal path), and Python never expands ``~`` in
``PYTHONPATH``. ``$HOME`` IS allowed in the shell-only paths (``gold_dir``/``venv``/
``repo_root``/``apptainer_sif``: they appear only inside the bash body, where double quotes
expand variables) but NOT in ``remote_root`` (directive sink). Callers expand user-supplied
``~`` against the REAL remote home via ``submit.remote_home`` + ``submit.expand_remote``.

    Defaults implement the researched decisions: EF/V100 pool, ``-tc`` = the full pool width,
    priority 0 (the caller passes the §14.3 ladder value: 0 / -100 / -200 / -500), cores scale
    with the pack (4 per concurrent training), walltime scales with the pack wave (1h30 per
    §15's one-wave shape, 3h for pack=1's conservative margin).

    ``device`` selects the LANE (2026-07-26, the CPU-lane build — dossier §0-PRE):

    * ``"cuda"`` (default, unchanged): requests ``-l gpu=1`` + ``-ac allow=<pool>``.
    * ``"cpu"``: NO ``gpu`` request and NO pool ``allow`` (a CPU job places on any node type, which
      is the whole point — the d pool alone is 10,584 cores vs 74 GPUs cluster-wide), ``--nv`` is
      dropped from the Apptainer line, and ``cores`` defaults to ONE PER PACKED TRAINING (a
      training is single-threaded; the 4-per-training GPU sizing would over-request 4x).
      Pass ``pool`` explicitly to pin a CPU node type (e.g. ``"D"``/``"B"``/``"T"``).

    Two guards encode live-probed Myriad facts (2026-07-26); both fail LOUD at render:

    * **``-pe smp 36`` is an EXCLUSIVE WHOLE-NODE request.** UCL's JSV silently adds ``exb=true``
      + ``exd=true`` when the core count equals a full node, so the job needs an ENTIRELY EMPTY
      node and starves (job ``cpucurve_d`` sat queued 2+ days). 35 is clean; 36 is not.
    * **Apptainer is not on every node** (``node-d00a-230`` had none): the venv python lives INSIDE
      the ``.sif``, so a missing container means ``rc=127`` after the slot was already granted. The
      rendered script probes for it and exits with a named error instead.

    ``entry_module`` selects the on-node entry point. The default trains the task's specs; pass
    ``"src.cluster.bayes_chain"`` to run the WHOLE bayes_opt GP chain inside one job instead of
    dispatching its 30 sequential proposals as 30 separate array-of-1 jobs (each paying a queue
    wait). That packaging change is what makes the GPU lane worth having for the campaign's
    critical path — see ``src/cluster/bayes_chain.py`` and ``src/cluster/lanes.py``.
