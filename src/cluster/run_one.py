    The S6 sealed-leg audit works by comparing env-fingerprint labels: a CPU/GPU mix shows two
    distinct labels and is flagged. That only works if the label records what RAN. It previously
    recorded ``spec.get("device", "cuda")`` — the REQUEST — and the two differ in a case that is
    live on the CPU lane:

      * ``opts`` carries NO ``device`` key at all (its keys are train_steps…window), and
        ``parallel._spec`` does not add one, so every spec the **bayes_opt GP chain** builds on-node
        (``bayes_chain._chain_specs`` → ``_family_spec`` → ``_spec``) reaches ``_run_single``
        WITHOUT a device and is defaulted to ``"cuda"`` there. ``campaign``'s explicit injection
        (``specs = [{**s, "device": device} …]``) fires only for specs IT builds, and only when
        ``device != "cuda"`` — the chain runs as its own job and never passes through it.
      * A CPU-lane job requests no GPU at all (``jobscript``: ``gpu_line`` is empty for
        ``device == "cpu"``), so that ``"cuda"`` request finds no device and torch falls back to CPU.

    The training therefore ran on CPU while the label said ``dev=cuda`` — the audit would have been
    reading a fiction, and on a node where a GPU *was* visible it would have missed a genuine mix.
    Resolving against ``torch.cuda.is_available()`` makes the label true in both cases: an honest
    ``cpu`` when the request fell back, and a real ``cuda`` when it did not — so a mix is flagged
    because it happened, not because a default was guessed.

    Falls back to the requested string if torch cannot be imported (never break archival over a
