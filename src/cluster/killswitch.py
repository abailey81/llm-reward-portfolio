"""Administrative-kill detection and GRADUATED RETREAT for the Myriad campaign.

WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-07-26). The campaign's throughput comes from holding a large, continuously
fed queue of small CPU jobs (measured: 636 concurrent cores; see
``docs/MYRIAD_EXPERT_DOSSIER_2026-07-24.md`` §0-PRE). UCL's fair-use rule (R8) is a *staff judgment
call* — "staff may kill jobs impairing shared resources" — so the realistic adverse event is not a
crash but an ADMINISTRATOR deliberately killing our jobs.

The driver's existing failure handling is exactly wrong for that case: it treats task death as
transport/node failure and REQUEUES (``ledger.MAX_RETRIES``). Blind resubmission immediately after
an administrative kill is the behaviour that escalates "your jobs were killed" into "your account
was suspended" — and Tamer's standing instruction is that **preserving Myriad access outranks
throughput**. So the system must be able to tell the two apart and RETREAT rather than fight.

THE DISCRIMINATOR. The three ways our tasks die have different fingerprints, and the epilogue
ledger the jobscript already writes (``{"task","host","gpu","rc","secs"}`` per task) carries
exactly the fields needed to separate them:

======================  =========================================================================
node failure            deaths concentrated on ONE host (the node fell over); ``-r y`` requeue is
                        correct and costs nobody anything.
walltime kill           ``rc`` 137/143 with ``secs`` ~= the requested ``h_rt``; expected, per-task,
                        uncorrelated across hosts. Fix the sizing, not the footprint.
**administrative kill** MANY deaths in a SHORT window spread across MANY DISTINCT hosts, none of
                        them walltime-proximate. No node failure looks like this: a human ran
                        ``qdel`` over our job list.
======================  =========================================================================

THE RESPONSE IS ASYMMETRIC BY DESIGN. False-positive cost (we pause a healthy campaign and ask a
human) is a few hours of throughput on a run that has ~7 days of calendar slack. False-negative
cost (we hammer the scheduler straight after an admin kill) is the account. So the detector is
deliberately tuned to retreat on ambiguous evidence, and the concurrency cap it sets is
**MONOTONE NON-INCREASING**: nothing in this module ever raises the cap back up. Only a human
clearing the incident file does that.

⚠ RETREAT IS *NOT* DEPRIORITISATION. Reducing our FOOTPRINT (submitting fewer concurrent jobs) is
a courtesy lever entirely under our control. Lowering our SGE *priority* (``qalter -p <negative>``)
is FORBIDDEN, always, by the standing order in ``CLAUDE.md`` — and this module never does it. The
two are different things and must not be confused.

#: RUNAWAY BACKSTOP — deliberately NOT a policy limit (revised 2026-07-26; Tamer: *"if it would
#: offer us say 2000, why would we reject?"*).
#:
#: THE POLICY IS: **take whatever the scheduler grants, minus a reserve for other users.** SGE's
#: fair-share IS the allocation mechanism — if it dispatches our jobs it has already arbitrated our
#: entitlement against every other user, so declining granted capacity is pure loss with no
#: principled justification. The earlier 640 (then 2560) hard caps were conservatism, not policy;
#: they cost campaign speed to buy nothing, because the two constraints that actually protect our
#: access are :data:`FREE_CORE_RESERVE` (we can never be the reason someone waits for a CPU slot)
#: and the administrative-kill retreat below.
#:
#: Note the arithmetic that makes this uncontroversial: the campaign's total work is FIXED
#: (1,800 + 71n trainings — corrected 2026-07-26 from a stale "1,740 + 69n"; see
#: :func:`lanes.total_trainings`), so total core-hours are the same however fast we take them — 636 cores
#: x 23.4 d ~= 337k core-h vs 2,560 x 5.8 d ~= 356k. Going faster does not consume more of Myriad;
#: it consumes the same amount in a shorter window, and UCL's own criterion explicitly permits
#: impact that is *"not of long duration"*. What the rate buys is schedule robustness: at 636 cores
#: the 31-day GO->Aug-27 window holds only ~7 days of slack.
#:
#: This value therefore exists ONLY to stop a bug (a loop that submits 100k tasks) from running
#: away. It is set far above any rate the scheduler has ever granted us — the observed plateau is
#: ~75 concurrent jobs — so in normal operation it never binds.
ABSOLUTE_CORE_CEILING = 8192

#: THE COURTESY GUARANTEE, and the reason a high ceiling is defensible: we never consume the last
#: cores. Whatever else the arithmetic says, leave at least this many cores free cluster-wide, so
#: our campaign can never be the reason another user waits for a plain CPU slot. This binds BEFORE
#: the ceiling — on a busy cluster it drives the target to zero on its own.
FREE_CORE_RESERVE = 1000

INCIDENT_FILENAME = "MYRIAD_KILL_INCIDENT.json"

#: Deaths must be at least this many, within :data:`WINDOW_SECS`, across at least
#: :data:`MIN_DISTINCT_HOSTS` hosts, before we call it an administrative kill. Tuned to retreat
#: readily: 8 INFRASTRUCTURE tasks dying across 4 nodes inside 5 minutes has no benign explanation.
#: (2026-07-28: "infrastructure" is load-bearing in that sentence — see :data:`_APPLICATION_EXIT_RC`.
#: There IS a benign explanation for 8 *application* exits in that window, and it is a registered
#: deliverable of this study.)
MIN_DEATHS = 8
MIN_DISTINCT_HOSTS = 4
WINDOW_SECS = 300.0

#: A death is "walltime-proximate" (i.e. an expected h_rt kill, not an admin kill) if the task ran
#: for at least this fraction of its requested walltime.
WALLTIME_FRACTION = 0.9

#: Exit codes that are an APPLICATION verdict, not an infrastructure death — excluded from the
#: administrative-kill burst test.
#:
#: ``run_one.main`` ends with ``return 0 if n_ok == len(rows) else 1``, and its own comment records
#: that a sandbox/contract reject "surfaced as a bare rc=1". An LLM writing a reward that fails the
#: sandbox is THE PHENOMENON UNDER STUDY — ``qwen3.5-9b``'s measured ~17 % gate-pass rate makes such
#: rejects frequent BY DESIGN — and a batch of them lands fast, on many hosts at once, which is
#: precisely the shape this detector calls an administrative qdel.
#:
#: MEASURED on the RUN 1 archive: the worst 300 s burst of rc=1 deaths was **7 across 6 hosts** —
#: ONE death under ``MIN_DEATHS`` and already past ``MIN_DISTINCT_HOSTS``. And only **61 %** of
#: RUN 1's candidate slots ever reached a node — 621 records + 59 genuine rejects = 680 of ~1,119 —
#: because the cross-line reject collision suppressed **439 (39 %)** UNSUBMITTED and unjudged. With
#: that defect fixed the flow is ~**1.65x** denser, so the threshold would be crossed — writing
#: ``MYRIAD_KILL_INCIDENT.json`` and hard-blocking submission on all twelve lines until a human
#: clears it. Fixing one defect unmasked the next.
#:
#: Excluding rc=1 cannot weaken admin-kill detection, and that is the point rather than a trade-off:
#: an administrative ``qdel`` terminates by SIGNAL (rc 137/143) or the job never starts (rc 126/127);
#: a clean ``1`` can only be produced by our own ``return 1``. It therefore carries no evidence about
#: administrative action in either direction. ``ledger.host_task_counts`` already reached the same
#: conclusion for the bad-node detector (``_NOT_A_NODE_FAULT_RC``) and deferred rc=1 to "the
#: killswitch" — which was counting it as an unexplained death. Neither owner treated it as what it
#: is. Transient application failures remain fully handled elsewhere: the driver retries them and
#: ledgers ``retries_exhausted``, and permanent ones leave a ``_rejects`` marker.

    The insight from the 2026-07-26 capacity probe: **~5,000 cores sat FREE while ~2,000 jobs
    pended** — the pending queue wants GPUs and large memory, not plain cores. So the courteous
    move and the fast move coincide: take plain CPU cores when they are idle, and stand down when
    they are contested. A fixed footprint cannot do that; this scales with what is actually spare.

    **Take what the scheduler grants.** The share is deliberately AGGRESSIVE — the protection is
    the reserve floor below, not a timid share — because declining capacity SGE has already
    arbitrated in our favour costs campaign speed and buys nothing:

    Four clamps then apply, TIGHTEST WINS, in increasing order of authority:

    1. the pressure-scaled share above;
