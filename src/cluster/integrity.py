"""The EFFECT-BLIND integrity report for the C3 review gate (PLAN §13: "counts-only monitoring;
single-look discipline"; control cascade §13.3 "effect-blind by construction").

Tamer's review checkpoint between the all-arms n=30 design floor (C3) and the uniform-n sweep (C4)
must NOT look at results — conditioning continuation on observed effects is optional stopping and
would invalidate the pre-registered single-look inference. What it CAN (and should) verify, very
carefully, is EXECUTION: did every unit train, complete, and archive exactly as designed?

This module writes that report: completeness counts (search candidates vs the matched budget,
k-seed integrity, test seeds vs the core set), failure censuses (F5 ledgers), and homogeneity
censuses (device + env-fingerprint labels across the sealed leg). It NEVER reads ``val_fitness``,
``test_sharpe``, ``test_cvar05``, ``test_returns``, or ``tail_stats`` values — only presence.

    thread counts, BLAS settings — live in ``env.json`` and are invisible to the label. They are
    also invisible to ``env_json_sha256``, because that digest includes the run's ``seed``, so two
    records on identical hardware hash differently and two records on DIFFERENT hardware cannot be
    told apart by it either. The hash is provenance; it is not a substrate key.

    That gap is not hypothetical. On 2026-07-28 the SEARCH leg held 116 records on an
    ``Intel Xeon Gold 6240`` and **1 on a Gold 6140** — different microarchitectures, so
    ``-ac allow=d`` confines placement to the d-class WITHOUT guaranteeing one CPU model. On the
    search leg that is a tolerable nuisance (it changes only WHICH candidate is selected). On the
    SCORED leg it would silently confound every paired contrast, and nothing was watching for it.

    Missing/unreadable ``env.json`` is counted under ``"<no env.json>"`` rather than skipped: a
