"""Cluster campaign orchestrator — the generation-level composition (PLAN §7 Phase A / §12 B-A1).

Turns the batch driver (:func:`src.cluster.driver.run_batch`) into the full multi-arm campaign,
split laptop/cluster: **authoring + reflection + selection run on the LAPTOP** (API keys are
laptop-only, R10); **training runs on Myriad**. The load-bearing invariant is LAPTOP↔CLUSTER
PARITY — every science primitive is the SAME object the certified local paths use:

* authoring/reflection: ``build_prompt_set`` + ``LLMClient`` + ``schema.build_block`` +
  ``_diversity_directive`` + ``_REFLECTION_PREAMBLE`` (identical to ``parallel._drive_llm_arm``);
* the reflect-on-generation-BEST protocol (``loop.py`` M5) — candidates within a generation are
  INDEPENDENT (they reflect on the PREVIOUS generation's best, never on each other), so training
  them as ONE SGE array is scientifically identical to pool-training them ("adaptive execution,
  invariant design", §13);
* the search worker (``parallel.train_candidate``) + the sealed-leg worker
  (``test_leg._test_seed_worker``) + the record schema (``parallel._archive`` /
  ``test_leg.build_test_record``) — a cluster record is byte-compatible with the local one;
* the F5 failures ledger + search-replay resume (so a mid-search resume never re-authors a
  ledgered candidate against the non-deterministic LLM, which could silently change the winner).

Only the SCHEDULING differs. Throughput (PLAN §5/§14) is maximised WITHOUT breaking any of this:

* the **test leg is one embarrassingly-parallel array** (``-tc`` = full pool) — 93% of the GPU
  hours at maximum concurrency;
* **per-arm search→test pipelines run concurrently** with ZERO barriers — the moment an arm's
  search completes, its winner freezes and its test array floods WHILE other arms still search;
* authoring is serialised across arms (a shared lock) so the API stays rate-limit-safe, while the
  training arrays interleave freely;
* one GPU pool per contrast (device homogeneity holds within every analysis unit).

Everything is injectable (``run_batch``/``select_winner``/``freeze_winner``/author lock/guard) so
the WHOLE campaign is unit-tested against a fake cluster + the keyless stub author, no network/GPU.

    Mirrors ``scripts/run_campaign.run_h3_singleshot`` stage-for-stage on the cluster primitives:
    the **distributional** arm re-run at ``generations = h3_singleshot_generations`` (1 — every
    candidate authors from the INITIAL prompt; ``run_search_arm``'s reflection block never fires
    because ``prev_block`` only becomes non-None after a completed generation), the SAME candidate
    budget and agent config (matched compute, DEEP_H3 §4), the IDENTICAL winner selector, and the
    sealed test leg at the SAME campaign seeds.

    Archives to the SEPARATE ``search_h3_singleshot/`` / ``frozen_h3_singleshot/`` /
    ``test_h3_singleshot/`` roots — laptop-layout parity, so ``analyze_campaign``'s H3 loader reads
    both substrates identically. Root disjointness is STRUCTURAL (a ``dataclasses.replace``d
    ClusterRun): the P4 audit hazard was that same-root reuse would let the compacted resume ADOPT
    headline run_ids and fabricate the H3 null. Batch names are force-prefixed ``h3ss_`` so this
    invocation can never adopt (or be adopted by) the headline campaign's queued arrays even when
    both share a ``--batch-tag`` namespace.
