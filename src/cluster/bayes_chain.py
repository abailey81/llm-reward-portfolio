"""Run the ENTIRE bayes_opt GP-EI chain inside ONE cluster job (the campaign's critical path).

WHY. ``bayes_opt`` is H4b's control arm and the campaign's LONGEST serial path: ``n_init=5``
parallel points plus **25 strictly sequential** GP-EI iterations, each a full 400k-step training
(``src/search/bayes_opt.py``). Once CPU capacity passes ~1,640 cores this chain — not throughput —
is what the whole campaign waits on (``src/cluster/lanes.py``).

The driver-side implementation (``campaign.run_family_search_arm``) trains each proposal as its own
**array-of-1 cluster job**, so the chain pays a QUEUE WAIT 30 times over. On CPU that is tolerable
(~10 min/cycle, ~2%). On GPU it is fatal: our GPU jobs have queued for hours-to-days, so 25
dispatches at even 2 h each bolt ~50 h of pure waiting onto ~27 h of compute — silently destroying
the single biggest speed-up available to the campaign. Running the loop ON THE NODE collapses that
to ONE queue wait.

WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** CHANGE — the science is untouched, deliberately and completely:

* the SAME ``bayes_opt_over_template`` GP (Matern-2.5 EI, ``n_init=5``, Snoek et al. 2012),
* the SAME seed, so the SAME proposal sequence,
* the SAME matched candidate budget and the SAME ``B*`` per candidate,
* the SAME certified training path — ``run_one._run_single`` after ``_worker_init()``, i.e. exactly
  what a normal task executes (the ``pack==1`` inline path already trains specs sequentially
  in-process, and the P18 audit made it share the pooled path's environment contract, so this
  introduces NO new numerical surface),
* the SAME candidate ids (``<arm>-c<i>``) and archive layout, so records written here are
  byte-interchangeable with driver-produced ones and either path can resume the other's work.

Speed here is bought purely by REMOVING QUEUE LATENCY. Nothing about the optimiser, its budget, or
its comparability to the LLM arms is weakened — which matters because ``bayes_opt`` is the control
the LLM must BEAT, so every algorithmic "speed-up" (raising ``n_init``, batch/q-EI, a reduced search
budget) would make our own hypothesis look better and is refused on integrity grounds.

DEADLINE AWARENESS (what makes this work on CPU as well as GPU). SGE caps walltime at 48 h for
2-36 cores and 72 h for 1 core, but the chain needs ~27 h on a GPU and ~214 h on a CPU core. So the
runner takes a wall-clock budget and stops cleanly before it would be killed, having archived every
completed candidate. Because the loop resumes by ARCHIVE REPLAY — completed candidates return their
recorded fitness without retraining — a restart re-derives the identical GP state and continues.
One GPU job finishes the chain; ~4 chained 72 h CPU jobs do the same with 4 queue waits instead
of 25.

    ----------

        Where per-candidate specs are recorded (mirrors ``run.search_spec_root()``).
    k_seeds : int
        ``search_seeds_per_candidate`` (B-A2). 1 = the byte-identical single-seed default.
    deadline_secs : float, optional
        Wall budget. ``None`` = run to completion (use only when the walltime genuinely fits).
    est_iter_secs : float, optional
        Expected seconds per iteration, used for the deadline check BEFORE any iteration has
        completed. Without it the first iteration of each job starts "blind" and may be SIGKILLed
        at the walltime — recoverable (archive replay loses only that one candidate) but wasteful.
        The campaign knows this number from the measured rate: ``train_steps / steps_per_s``, i.e.
        ~8.55 h on a CPU core (13.0 steps/s) or ~1.09 h on a GPU at pack-1 (102 steps/s). PASS IT.
