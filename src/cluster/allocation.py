"""The allocation ADVISOR — the BRAIN of the adaptive speed system (2026-07-24).

Pure decision logic over a telemetry :class:`~src.cluster.telemetry.Snapshot` + our own measured
throughput, emitting THE ALLOCATION PLAN: pool assignments, the exact ``--seed-pool-blocks``
stripe string, the chunking regime, pack recommendations, and recomputed milestone ETAs.

INVARIANTS ENCODED (so every recommendation is legal by construction):
- NEVER emits any priority action (the CLAUDE.md ★ rule; ``-p`` is not in this module's alphabet).
- CRN device homogeneity: stripes are contiguous pool-homogeneous blocks WITHIN each rung
  segment (the ratified block structure); pool/pack changes apply to NEW batches only.
- ADVISORY ONLY: the plan is printed/archived; applying it is an explicit human/launcher act.

Ground truth: docs/MYRIAD_EXPERT_DOSSIER_2026-07-24.md (the priority formula, the two-regime
chunking doctrine §3b, pool speeds §2) + the ratified runbook levers (§10).
