"""Batch-driver kernel (§12.4 driver loop): submit → poll → requeue → until done.

Design law: THE ARCHIVE IS THE ONLY TRUTH. Every cycle re-derives the remaining work from the
compacted-resume diff (``pending_specs`` over pulled records); scheduler output decides only
WHEN to act (no live batch job + work remaining → a submission round), and ``qacct`` text is
harvested as FORENSICS, never as completion truth. SGE's own walltime is the stall detector: a
wedged task is killed at ``h_rt``, the array drains, the job leaves the queue, and the next
cycle's requeue round re-emits exactly the missing run_ids (bounded by
:data:`src.cluster.ledger.MAX_RETRIES`, then permanently ledgered). A driver crash/restart is
harmless for the same reason — rerunning :func:`run_batch` resumes from the diff (retry counts
reset on restart: a human intervened, so a fresh retry budget is the intended semantics).

Everything is injectable (runner/push/pull/sleep/clock) so the FULL loop is unit-tested with
zero network; production wires :func:`src.cluster.submit.ssh_runner` and the tar-over-ssh
transports. The generation-level composition (LLM authoring → specs per arm/generation, marker
hold-chains between search and test arrays) lives with the campaign scripts ON GO; this kernel
is the one they all call.

    Resume-safe + crash-safe by construction: the FIRST action of every cycle is a pull + the

    where the archive says — including adopting a still-queued job from a previous driver
    invocation (the double-submit guard matches this batch's jobnames in the queue). Requeue
    naming is ``base``, ``base_r1``, ``base_r2``, …; name reuse across driver restarts is
    harmless because specs are content-addressed and completed run_ids are never re-emitted.

    Summary: ``{"ok", "completed", "total", "rounds", "exhausted", "job_ids"}`` where ``ok`` is
    True iff every spec's run_id is archived; ``exhausted`` lists run_ids abandoned after
    :data:`~src.cluster.ledger.MAX_RETRIES` requeues (each also a permanent-ledger row).

    LONG-OUTAGE TOLERANCE (resume from ANY stoppage). Transport (VPN/ssh) is allowed to blip: a
    consecutive-failure streak is fatal only once it persists past BOTH bounds' first trip —
    ``max_consecutive_errors`` cycles OR ``max_transport_outage_secs`` wall-seconds (default 12 h).
    The time bound is the real guard (decoupled from ``poll_secs``): the driver PATIENTLY rides out a
    multi-hour VPN/network/Myriad-login outage instead of dying every 2 h, because the archive is the
    truth and nothing is lost by waiting — the queued Myriad arrays keep training regardless of the
    laptop driver's connectivity. Past the bound it raises cleanly (the supervisor relaunches with
    ``--resume`` when connectivity returns); a genuinely permanent break is thus surfaced, not hidden.

    HEARTBEAT (observability). When ``heartbeat`` is given it is called once per cycle with a
    read-only status snapshot ``{ts, done, pending, exhausted, rounds, queue_names, pull_failures,
    ops_failures, phase}`` — the driver-liveness + queue lease the sentinel consumes (it never opens
