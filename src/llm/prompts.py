"""Prompt assembly for the LLM reward-designer (C3 fix; FINAL_PLAN F.8; prompts/README T4).

The discovery loop must hand the LLM the ENVIRONMENT INTERFACE — the observation/action
shapes, the step semantics, the reward contract, and the cost model — or it is prompted
with a contentless one-liner and writes blind (adversarial-review finding **C3**). Before
this module, ``src/llm/loop.py`` used hardcoded minimal prompts and never read ``prompts/``.

This module loads the ``system.txt`` and ``initial_generation.txt`` TEMPLATES from ``prompts/``
(single source of truth, no hardcoding) and fills the ``{ENV_INTERFACE}`` placeholder in the
initial prompt from the *anonymised* env spec (no tickers, no dates — N3). The reflection turn is
NOT templated here: the loop composes it from its built-in ``_REFLECTION_PREAMBLE`` plus the
per-arm ``{ARM_BLOCK}`` rendered at runtime by ``src/feedback/schema.build_block`` — so
``reflection.txt`` is intentionally not loaded (it was dead: no path ever substituted its markers).

The rendered :class:`PromptSet` (``system`` + ``initial``) is passed to ``run_loop`` via
``cfg["prompts"]``; when absent the loop falls back to its built-in minimal prompts, so unit
tests need no prompt files.
